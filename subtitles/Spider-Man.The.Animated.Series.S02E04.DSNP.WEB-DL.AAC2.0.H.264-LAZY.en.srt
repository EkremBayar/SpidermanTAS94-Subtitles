To get him off my back,

166
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,125
I'll share some of my
preliminary findings

167
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,000
with the press for now.

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,500
But my real work,

169
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,875
for the good of mankind,

170
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:44,208
won't be finished until
I perform one final test.

171
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,875
Penny for your
thoughts, Spider-Man.

172
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,166
I mean you no harm.

173
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,708
I just want to talk.

174
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:58,750
[Spider-Man] I've heard
all I want to hear

175
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,208
from you X-people.

176
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,625
Excuse me.

177
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,000
Please, wait.

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,458
Have you heard of the
Brand Corporation?

179
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,250
A man there named
Herbert Landon

180
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,625
has been studying your
particular form of mutation.

181
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,083
Perhaps he can reverse it.

182
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,583
He will be presenting
his findings

183
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,291
at the convention hall
tomorrow.

184
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,458
Lewald, I see one!

185
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,250
Talk about luck!

186
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,000
I knew if we watched Xavier's
property long enough,

187
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,458
we'd find a mutant.

188
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,333
He's the world's
top mutie lover.

189
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,125
-But is Spider-Man a mutant?
-Who cares?

190
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,166
There's Henry McCoy!

191
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,000
Now we're talking mutants.

192
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,833
Sounds most promising,
don't you agree?

193
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:43,000
[Spider-Man] Yeah.
Why are you going out
of your way for me?

194
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No one can turn his
back on another's pain.

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,583
I may be a mutant,
but I'm still human.

196
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,458
[Spider-Man] Well,
that's where we're different.

197
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,208
I'm not sure I still am.

198
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,000
How sad.

199
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,375
We are all alone until we
accept our need for others.

200
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,625
[guns cock]

201
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,875
Don't let him get away!

202
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,625
[groans]

203
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,458
Get the restraints on him.

204
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,833
[growls]

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,458
He's stunned.

206
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,583
Now, get the net.

207
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,875
[groans]

208
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,750
Call the boss.

209
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,833
Tell him we've got what he
needs, a real, live mutant.

210
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,375
Mary Jane, why do
I torture myself

211
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,125
with thoughts of
us being together?

212
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,875
Why would you want to be
with a mutated thing like me?

213
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:05,250
I should just leave here,
spare everyone the pain.

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

215
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,375
Uncle Ben, almost forgot
to say good-bye to you.

216
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,416
[Ben] Did you think things
were going to be easy, boy?

217
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,458
-Huh, did you?
-[Peter strains]

218
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,458
But I, I,
I can't do it, Uncle Ben.

219
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,583
You know my rotten luck.

220
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,291
Boy, good or bad luck

221
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,458
is nothing but the
right or wrong mix

222
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,458
of opportunity, preparation,
and confidence.

223
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,000
Now, I know you're prepared
because I had a hand in that.

224
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,291
Son, what you lack
is confidence.

225
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,291
Peter, you can do anything

226
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,291
as long as you don't
give up on yourself.

227
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,875
[Spider-Man] You always did
believe in me, Uncle Ben,

228
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,375
and you always were right.

229
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,166
I can't quit.

230
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,083
I've got to keep fighting.

231
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,708
Cyclops, the engines
are working fine now.

232
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,958
Can't we, please, go back?

233
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,875
Ah, come on, Jubilee,
one more time.

234
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,125
-[Wolverine] Blackbird,
come in.
-Blackbird here.

235
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,500
Either of you see
Beast this morning?

236
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,875
His bed ain't been slept in.

237
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,958
-You tried the lab?
-Yeah.

238
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,583
He gets working on something

239
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,583
and forgets about little
things like sleep.

240
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,291
Already checked the lab.

241
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,333
Over and out.

242
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,333
You seem overly
worried about Hank.

243
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,208
-Why?
-I don't know.

244
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,375
He's been acting weird lately.

245
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,875
He's usually solid
as a rock, but now--

246
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,375
That's the side he
chooses to show us,

247
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,250
but we've all got
our own private pain.

248
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,083
You, of all people,
should know that, Logan.

249
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,416
[sniffing]
Beast and Spider-Man.

250
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,166
[sniffing]

251
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:54,583
Oh, and a bunch of guys
I never smelled before.

252
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,000
A stinking trap.

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,458
That punk's gonna pay,

254
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,958
big time.

255
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,750
Brand Corporation must have
made a huge breakthrough

256
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,333
on this mutie research.

257
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,208
Oh, that's what I've heard.

258
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,000
You don't think they'd
let any of those muties

259
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,083
into this presentation, do you?

260
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:18,333
I don't want to be within a
thousand miles of those freaks.

261
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,708
I'm surprised at you,
Cecily, really surprised.

262
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,208
[scoffs] Mutie-lover.

263
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,000
[man] I now present

264
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,208
Herbert Landon,
of the Brand Corporation.

265
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,125
Thank you, ladies and
gentlemen, thank you.

266
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,708
I stand before you today

267
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,750
to announce the
dawning of a new age,

268
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,625
a new era in understanding
the genetic factors

269
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,708
which create the mutant strain.

270
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,583
As most of you know,

271
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,625
DNA, the microscopic
strands of chemicals

272
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:52,125
in every human and animal
cell contains the code

273
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,458
for all of our physical traits,

274
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:58,416
but, occasionally, the strands
are uniquely imperfect,

275
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,500
and we call the result mutancy.

276
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,166
Because of the complexity

277
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,875
and the minute size
of the strands,

278
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,875
scientists have been unable
to manipulate mutant DNA,

279
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,708
until now.

280
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,458
Thanks to the newest
generation of super-computers,

281
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,708
we at the Brand Corporation

282
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,333
are on the verge of one of
the greatest discoveries.

283
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,000
[Peter] Just when it was
starting to get interesting.

284
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,708
Surprised, Landon?

285
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,083
Don't be.

286
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,500
There's nowhere you
can hide from me.

287
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,833
-[people screaming]
-Hobgoblin.

288
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,208
I guess this
meeting's adjourned.

289
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,166
Oh, please. [chuckling]

290
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,250
You didn't think I'd
fall for that old

291
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,000
exploding warehouse
trick, did you?

292
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,625
What kind of a fool
do you take me for?

293
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,833
[Spider-Man] Personally,
I'd never call you a fool.

294
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,833
That'd be an insult
to fools everywhere.

295
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,750
I'll take care of him.

296
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,875
[Hobgoblin] I didn't
come here for you,

297
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,958
but I'll gladly
take a two-for-one.

298
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,000
[grunts]

299
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,208
[Spider-Man] Air Arachnid,
the only way to fly.

300
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,375
I'll take a rain
check on my two-fer.

301
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,625
[crowd clamoring]

302
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:17,000
Remember, Landon, we've still
got our arrangement,

303
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,833
but now, I intend to
quintuple your fee!

304
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,958
[cackling]

305
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,833
[crowd clamoring]

306
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,875
[Spider-Man] The ceiling!

307
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,833
I've got to keep it
from falling

308
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,708
long enough for the
crowd to get out.

309
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,875
Hang together.

310
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,291
Hang together.

311
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,166
We must leave.

312
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,416
But, but we have to help him.

313
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,458
He risked his life to save you.

314
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,208
[Landon] There's
nothing we can do.

315
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,625
[Spider-Man] It's collapsing.

316
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,750
I've failed.

317
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,000
Huh?

318
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,750
[crowd screaming]

319
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,000
[Spider-Man] Something held
the ceiling up

320
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,166
long enough for me to get away.

321
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,375
But what?

322
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,333
Well, Landon got away okay.

323
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,708
I wonder why
Hobgoblin's after him.

324
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,875
One thing's for sure,
Hobgoblin won't quit.

325
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,166
He'll chase Landon back
to the Brand Corporation.

326
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,583
[helicopter blades whirring]

327
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,000
Seems quiet enough.

328
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,583
[groaning]

329
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,250
What?

330
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,250
-[electricity crackles]
-[screams]

331
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,000
[Landon] I wouldn't
try that again.

332
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,708
We're now increasing
the voltage.

333
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,416
Landon.

334
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,750
-What is the meaning of this?
-Can't you guess?

335
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,416
Don't you remember
when we worked together

336
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:42,083
all those years ago,
Dr. Hank McCoy?

337
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,958
Remember how eager you
were to find a cure

338
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,000
for your growing mutancy?

339
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,250
So eager that you
risked destroying yourself
in the process.

340
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,958
That was a lifetime ago.

341
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,000
I've changed a great
deal since then.

342
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Obviously, you're
one of them now.

343
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,500
You've changed, all right,
but I haven't.

344
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,875
I intend to use the
research you began

345
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,875
to destroy all mutants.

346
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,750
Herbert, this is genocide.

347
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,875
You can't be serious.

348
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,250
Oh, no?

349
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,291
This chemical
was designed by me

350
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:20,208
to reduce the physio-electric
energy of mutant DNA

351
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,750
unraveling it into nothingness.

352
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,583
It will make mutant cells

353
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,583
turn against them and
destroy their very bodies.

354
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:31,958
The human race will
be purified once more.

355
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,000
And to make sure it works,

356
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,125
I'm going to test it on
you, my true blue friend.

357
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,958
The irony is I couldn't
have done any of this

358
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:46,375
without your
brilliant research.

359
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,208
The research you started

360
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,583
to prevent yourself from
turning into a hairy animal.

361
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,000
[laughing]

362
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,833
[Spider-Man] At last.

363
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,291
Got to time this just right.

364
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,208
No!

365
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,708
[Spider-Man] Surprise!

366
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,250
You!

367
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,250
How did you know
I'd come here?

368
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,708
[Spider-Man] Lucky guess.

369
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,166
No more tricks.

370
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,583
Now, tell me.

371
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,458
Why do you want
to destroy Landon?

372
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:30,000
[chuckling] You clown,
I don't want to hurt him.

373
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,625
He's my bankroll.

374
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,625
He's paying me to
keep my mouth shut.

375
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:38,083
I know his dirty
little secret.

376
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,958
[Spider-Man] What secret?

377
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,583
Landon has a hidden agenda.

378
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,416
He's going to
destroy all mutants,

379
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:50,083
every last three-eyed,
six-legged, four-nosed

380
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,458
[Spider-Man]
I don't believe you.

381
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,416
Maybe if I looked
into your baby-blues--

382
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,083
[Wolverine] Spider-Man.

383
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,750
What have you done with Beast?

384
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,291
[Spider-Man] I don't know
what you're talking about.

385
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,958
[Wolverine] Yeah. Sure.

386
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,125
Beast told you
about this place.

387
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,000
That's how I knew
to find you here.

388
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,958
Looks like your memory
needs a little help.

389
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:17,333
-[gleeful chuckle]
-[roaring]

390
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,125
[laughing] How entertaining.

391
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,583
A fight to the bitter end.

392
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,333
Problem is, in this fight,

393
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,708
nobody's gonna win,

394
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,625
except me!
