168
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,416
They must be up to something.

169
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,708
I've been searching all night.

170
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,291
Now, it's almost morning.

171
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,583
If I'm not back before
Aunt May wakes up,

172
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,875
she'll be worried sick.
No.

173
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,000
Not again!

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,708
[screams]

175
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,583
[groans]

176
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,875
What's happening to me?

177
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,583
I left my clothes
on that high ledge.

178
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,416
Can't get to them now.

179
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,125
I've got to hide.

180
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,708
It'd be too easy for some
super villain to grab me

181
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,083
and take my mask off.

182
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,708
[Aunt May] Peter,
where have you been?

183
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:36,750
Out jogging.

184
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,208
Wearing a blanket?

185
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,291
Are you all right, dear?

186
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,500
Yes, Aunt May.

187
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,375
-Fine.
-You look pale to me.

188
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,291
I've just been up all night,
uh, studying.

189
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,250
Well, why don't you
just lie down and rest?

190
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,166
I'll bring some
breakfast for you.

191
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,875
Uh, oh, thanks, Aunt May.

192
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,458
You're the greatest.

193
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,625
[sighs]
I hope rest is all I need.

194
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,083
[groans]

195
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,083
[yawns]

196
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,500
Wow, I feel fantastic!

197
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,875
Yes, my spider powers are back,
at least for now.

198
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,833
Morning, dear.

199
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,500
I'm sorry I let you
sleep like that,

200
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,000
but you really must
have needed it.

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,625
Sleep like what?

202
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,708
Why, you slept all day
yesterday and all night.

203
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,833
What?

204
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,166
You mean it's Thursday!

205
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,708
Well, I tried to wake you
a couple of times,

206
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,875
but you kept turning over
and going back to sleep.

207
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,583
Ah, I'm late
for Dr. Connors's class!

208
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,166
Peter, your breakfast!

209
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,500
-Peter!
-[door thuds]

210
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,375
Oh, dear me, that boy.

211
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:44,750
[man] Neogenics,
the new science
of genetic exploration

212
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,125
and manipulation of DNA,

213
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,625
invented by Professor
Farley Stillwell
here at this college.

214
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,583
It's one of the most important
achievements of this century.

215
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,250
The Toombes Foundation
might be giving

216
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,875
Empire State University
grant money
to continue our research

217
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:05,166
if we can convince them
how important neogenics is.

218
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,583
That's up to all of us.

219
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,458
You are ESU's best
science students.

220
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,333
Consider this a contest.

221
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,708
Whoever conceives the most
original neogenics experiment

222
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,375
gets the job as my
research assistant

223
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,750
if the Toombes grant
is awarded to ESU.

224
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm going to win this, Debra.

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,583
You'll have to beat me
out first, Michael.

226
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,416
Nice of you to show up, Parker.

227
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,625
Good luck to you all.

228
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,708
-Thank you.
-[Peter sighs]

229
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,375
[Peter thinking] Great.

230
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,000
First, my powers go
wonky, now, this.

231
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,125
A little late, huh, Peter?

232
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,708
What's the matter?

233
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,208
Get wrapped up watching
cartoons this morning?

234
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,125
Not in the mood, Debra.

235
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,000
I had thought you would be
my main competition, Parker,

236
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,750
but you will be lucky to
make it to the starting line.

237
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,583
Don't forget, Michael,
the tortoise beat the hare.

238
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:58,125
In my country,
we eat tortoises.

239
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,166
Peter!

240
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,333
Hi, Felicia.

241
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,833
Felicia, what a splendid name.

242
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,875
Allow me to introduce myself.

243
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,416
I am Michael Morbius.

244
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,458
Uh-huh.

245
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,625
Charmed.

246
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,875
Please excuse us.

247
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,875
What B-movie did he come from?

248
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,458
The Revenge of Dracula's Ego.

249
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,458
-What's up?
-I need you to escort me

250
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,416
to the opening of my mother's
new science center tonight.

251
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,500
Hah. Wait a minute.

252
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,583
Are you asking me for a date?

253
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,583
Parker, you're the
only one I know

254
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,875
who can explain these boring
science exhibits to me.

255
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,583
Whoa, hold on,
answer the question.

256
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,708
Is it a date?

257
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,166
All right, all right.

258
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,625
You can call it a date
if you want.

259
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,458
Great!
I'll be there!

260
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,750
Naturally.

261
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,416
Meet me at The Coffee Bean
at 6:30.

262
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,708
Careful, Felicia.

263
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,708
I don't think he's
had his shots.

264
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,583
Flash, what do you want?

265
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,958
I want to know
what Parker's boss

266
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,416
is doing calling those crooks

267
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,875
the Spider-Man Six,
that's what.

268
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,250
The Spider-Man who?

269
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,458
J. Jonah Jameson
is not fooling me.

270
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,958
Spidey's a hero.

271
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,583
He's not any crime boss.

272
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:02,708
It's some kinda setup.

273
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,375
What are you talking about?

274
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,250
What's the matter, you been
asleep for the past 24 hours?

275
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,000
[John]
And here, we see it live,

276
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,750
just as I've always warned you.

277
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,500
Spider-Man leading one
of his criminal band,

278
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,708
the Spider-Man Six.

279
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,750
It's a setup, I tell ya.

280
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,208
What do you think, Parker?

281
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,750
Parker?

282
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,875
Where are you?

283
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,083
[Peter thinking] I go to
sleep for one lousy day,

284
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,958
and I wake up
in the Twilight Zone.

[Spider-Man]
Hold it, horn head.

-Bad move, Spidey!
-[horn wailing]

predictable, Mysterio!

Hey! He's mine!

Nonsense.

310
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,875
You merely softened
him up for me.

311
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,458
Make way for the Scorpion!

312
