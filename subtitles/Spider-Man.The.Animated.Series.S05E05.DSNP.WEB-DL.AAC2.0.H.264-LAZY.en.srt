That belonged to
Captain America.

00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:06,458
A scientist named

a super soldier.

The Five discovered that their
powers weren't permanent.

They created ring

With Cap, they were
the Six American Warriors.

16
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:40,958
One night, they stumbled onto
the most devious plot ever.

00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,833
I have just one
question for you.

171
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,583
Why did you call
yourself The Whizzer?

172
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,708
Hey, that's the sound I make.

173
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,458
Sure, these days
it sounds a little corny

174
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:56,083
but back then,
it was a swell name.

175
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:59,625
The only regret I have
is that I didn't continue

176
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,000
being a superhero.

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,166
Well, now we all
have one last chance

178
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,750
to prove ourselves again.

179
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,333
That's right.

180
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,625
This man who stole
your keys, The Kingpin,

181
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,375
he must be stopped.

182
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,250
This Doomsday machine has
been hanging over our lives

183
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,708
like the Sword of Damocles.

184
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,375
It's time we put an end to it.

185
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,458
Let's be realistic.

186
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,875
This is a young person's sport.

187
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,500
We'll all get ourselves hurt.

188
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,083
Maybe you're right,
Miss America.

189
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,125
What good can we do now?

190
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,291
Hey, wait.

191
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,000
Now, you may not
be in your prime

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,375
but I'd take you all anytime

193
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,083
over the crime
fighters of today.

194
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,833
I don't care what
the rest of you do.

195
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,291
I'm going to help
Spider-Man fight.

196
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,833
I'm ready for action.
Count me in.

197
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,000
Come on, Miss America.

198
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,708
For old times sake?

199
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,500
I'm with ya, as always.

200
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, all right.

201
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,458
You'll need somebody to
watch your achin' backs.

202
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,458
-Great!
-Thank you.

203
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,958
I brought something that
will help inspire us

204
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,250
through the coming battle.

205
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,083
All my searchers have failed.

206
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,583
I can't locate the final key.

207
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,625
Who has it?

208
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,875
He was called The Thunderer.

209
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,875
But his real name
Jerry Carstairs.

210
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,208
He has simply vanished
over the years.

211
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,875
Do you have any good news?

212
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,125
Yes, based on the
old coordinates

213
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,833
that the Parkers connected,

214
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:23,125
I've pinpointed the location
of the Doomsday Complex.

215
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,625
It's under some condemned
buildings in the Bronx.

216
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,250
I've created this device

217
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,000
that will guide you to
the exact point of entry.

218
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,333
Excellent, and then we
shall secure the location

219
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:38,583
while you continue to
work to find the last key.

220

[tense music playing]

221
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,875
Over that way.

222
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,375
No wonder it remained hidden.

223
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,625
Only the lowest form of vagrant

224
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,000
would inhabit these dwellings.

225
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Here's a good example.

226
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,958
What are you doing
around here, old man?

227
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,875
I was just trying to be quiet.

228
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,708
Shocker, Vulture, eliminate him.

229

[groaning]

231
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,458
Agents, it's time
to clean up America.

232
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,125
Okay, bird brain,
I'll teach you to pick on

233
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,708
a defenseless old lady.

[dramatic music playing]

238

My flying ability.

239
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,416
I can't sustain it.

240
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,708
Madeline!

241
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,250
I'm getting weak also.

242
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,291
We're too old.

243

[beeping]

246
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,166
What's that sound?

247
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,000
My ears.

248
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,083
Amazing.

249
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,000
Disguised as a homeless man,

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,583
The Thunderer's been keeping
watch over this place

251
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,833
the whole time.

252
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,208
The Thunderer.

253
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,000
Correct, I vowed to
protect this site

254
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,375
and after all these years,
I won't stop now.

255

[zapping]

256
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,000
No!

257
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,291
My powers are fading.

You all should have realized

264
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,583
you were no match for
my Insidious Warriors.

265
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,625
Bring me The Thunderer.

266
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,583
He must have the final statue.

267
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,708
Search him and his
discarded clothes.

268
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,500
Excellent.

269
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,583
Who would have
thought the final key

270
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,000
would be so close.

271
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,458
Add this to the other five.

272

[dramatic music playing]

273
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:35,166
Yes, oh yes,
it's the same evil place,

274
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,958
Just as we left it 50 years go.

275
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,250
It even smells the same.

276
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,250
This, my warriors,
is a moment to savor.

277
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:51,875
Each of you will share
in this triumphant event.

278

[clicking]

279

Let our rule of

[blasting]

No, not again,
it's sleeping gas.

[coughing]

285
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,583
Kragov, the Red Skull's son.

286
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,208
Oh!

287

[tense music playing]

288
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:41,125
Why did the Chameleon
turn on the Kingpin?

289
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,708
And what's his
connection to Kragov?

290
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,208
Thank you for
everything, my brother.

291
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,708
So you are the traitor?

292
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,083
You don't understand
any of this do you?

293
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,083
The Red Skull, my father,

294
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,000
created the
Chameleon's technology

295
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,958
and trained him how to use
it when he was just a boy.

296
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,458
He was like an adopted
son in our family.

297
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,625
And now, we shall
free our father.

298
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,458
It looks like our
leader has gotten us

299
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,458
into another fine mess, huh?

300
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:11,000
Ah, my guests have arrived.

301
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,083
Dr. Groitzing who
designed this complex

302
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,750
and Mr. Lenz was a German
spy in this country

303
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,875
during the war.

304
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,583
He led me here.

305
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,416
All we had to do was wait
for you to acquire the keys

306
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,000
and then take them from you.

307
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,875
Now, good doctor,
activate the portal controls,

308
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:33,625
and bring my father out of
the matter/anti-matter vortex.

309
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,125
That's how they
power this place,

310
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,833
a perpetual energy field

311
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,375
that keeps matter
locked in stasis.

312
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,750
It's been so many years.

313
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,583
Don't be coy with me, professor.

314
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,750
You know what to do.

315
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,583
Yes, yes, it's working!

316
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,750
Unbelievable!

317
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,958
The German War criminal?

318
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,750
The Red Skull.

319
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,125
Father, don't you recognize us?

320
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:00,958
It's me, your son, Rheinholdt.

321
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,958
You've been held for
50 years in a vortex.

322
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:08,250
We are in this Doomsday
Complex you built.

323
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,750
We've come to free you.

324
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,708
Rheinholdt?

325
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,166
You've aged.

326
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,000
And you have not, father,

327
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,708
because of the vortex.

328
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,416
Chameleon, my stepson?

329
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:22,000
This truly is a joyous occasion.

330
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,458
What? Can this be?

331
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,708
Five of the six
American Warriors.

332
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,625
[laughs] Amazing.

333
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,166
You are withered by time

334
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,375
while I remain

During the war,
this entire complex

was built by German agents

341
