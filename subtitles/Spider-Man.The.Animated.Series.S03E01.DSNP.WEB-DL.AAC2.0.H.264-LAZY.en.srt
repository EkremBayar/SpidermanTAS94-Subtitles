Uh-oh, someone's coming!

163
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, good, they didn't see me.

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,166
Well, at least I'm in.

165
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,583
Peter!

166
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,875
What are you doing here?

167
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,875
I've come to take you home,
Mary Jane.

168
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:40,166
Peter you don't understand!
My father is here!

169
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:44,333
Brother Mordo has reunited us.
I see Daddy every day.

170
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,375
Peter, it's just
what I've always dreamed of,

171
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,333
having a wonderful
relationship with my father.

172
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,875
We've become so close, nothing
can come between us again.

173
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,166
I can't go.

174
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,583
Mary Jane, what about
the things you were doing
earlier this evening?

175
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,125
The break-in
at Greenwich Village?

176
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,583
I-- I don't know
what you're talking about.

177
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,000
I was here this evening
with Daddy.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,583
No, you weren't.

179
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,958
Look, I've gotta
get you out of here.

180
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,000
You're not taking me!
I won't let you!

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,875
[alarm sounds]

182
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,375
[grunting]

183
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,875
Can't risk
using my spider powers

184
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,500
with all
these people watching.

185
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,416
Take him to Brother Mordo.

186
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,583
Mary Jane arrived here seeking
the truth about her father.

187
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,875
She has found it and found him.

188
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,291
Why would you deny her
such fulfillment?

189
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,958
Isn't that what
we're all longing for?

190
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,500
After all, isn't there someone

191
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,875
with whom
you want to be reunited?

192
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,958
Ah, yes.

193
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,375
Of course there is.

194
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,875
Mom?

195
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,333
Dad!

196
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,708
You're alive!

197
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,208
But-- But I was told--

198
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:58,291
It's all right, Peter,
everything...

199
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:02,583
...is all right.
I'm here with you now, son.

200
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:06,625
You're with us again,
and we'll never let you go.

201
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,000
Never.

202
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,083
Where am I?

203
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,708
What happened?

204
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,416
Did I really see my parents?

205
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,333
I've gotta get Mary Jane
and get out of here

206
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,708
before Mordo
brainwashes me, too!

207
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,333
My children,
our time is at hand!

208
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,708
We must dispel our enemies.

209
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,333
Listen to my words.

210
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,833
You are the army of Dormammu.

211
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:38,166
You must recover
the Wand of Watoomb.

212
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:43,958
Let nothing,
not even your own destruction,
stand in the way.

213
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,375
[Spider-Man]
Nothing must stand in the way.

214
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,250
[glass shatters]

215
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,208
Stand fast!

216
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,500
I am ready, Doctor.

217
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,458

[whooshing]

Spider-Man?!
What are you doing?!

221
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:05,291
Doctor, I can't
fight them all! I--

222
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:14,875
[grunts] Nothing will stand
in the way of Mordo's will,

223
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,000
not even you, Doctor Strange!

224
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,208
Spider-Man, listen to me!

225
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,625
Spider-Man!

226
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:28,875
O great
all-seeing Eye of Agamotto,

227
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,458
you must come to my aid!

228
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,083
As I suspected.

229
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,250
Omnipotent Vishanti,
empower my amulet,

230
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,458
remove this spell
that clouds his mind.

231
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,125
Doctor Strange,
how did I get here?

232
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,125
The all-seeing Eye of Agamotto
revealed to me

233
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,875
that you had been placed
under a hypnotic spell
by Mordo,

234
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:58,333
and now Mordo has
the Wand of Watoomb.
-The Wand of Watoomb!

235
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,958
I am overjoyed
with your success, my child.

236
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,583
Thank you, father.

237
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:08,458
Oh, Daddy, I love you.

238
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,583
And I love you, too, my child.

239
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:15,750
Our world is in grave peril
now that Mordo has the wand.

240
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,166
No doubt he will use it to try
to free the dread Dormammu.

241
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,708
Who?

242
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,458
Dormammu is
a powerful evil entity,

243
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,333
who travels
from dimension to dimension,

244
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:32,000
draining the light energy
out of all universes.

245
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,875
Now he wants to come
to feed on ours.

246
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:39,125
He must draw the life force
out of our reality or starve.

247
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,625
Dormammu has ultimate power.

248
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:45,333
If I face him, it will be
the struggle of my life.

249
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,708
But I'll be there to help you.

250
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,625
I must warn you,
the odds against us

251
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,750
returning alive
are astronomical.

252
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,708
Big deal, I've been
through the Bronx. I'm ready.

253
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:03,000
All is now prepared, Master.
The wand is ours.

254
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,166
I hunger
for new life energy to devour.

255
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,875
Release me
into your dimension!

256
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:13,625
With pleasure.
The time has come.

257
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,416
[thunderclap]

258
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,000
Thanks for the free trip, Doc,

259
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,875
This is saving me
a fortune in webbing.

Looks like they're
closed for the night.

00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,750
I invoke the Hosts of Hockoth!

263
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,416
[Spider-Man]
Remind me to call you

264
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,125
if I ever lose my house key.

265
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,250
Here we are again, Wong,
about to leap into the unknown

266
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,458
to fight the deadliest battle
of our lives.

267
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:43,166
-Exciting, is it not, Doctor?
-It is.

268
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,458
No offense, but you guys
are really weird.

269
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,625
[Doctor Strange]
Let us go.

Steal is mightier than wood!

And let's not forget,

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,000
good is mightier than evil!

[groans]

279
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,708
[Mordo]
By the power of the wand,

280
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:45,458
I release my master Dormammu
into this dimension!

281
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,458
[web shoots]

282
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,208
You borrowed this
without asking permission,

283
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,583
so I'll take this little
doohickey out of your hands!

284
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,000
Wong! We have to help him!

285
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,416
We cannot!
This is a mystical battle

286
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,250
that only Doctor Strange
can win.

287
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,708
My years of devotion
to the dark arts

288
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,750
have made me strong--

stronger than you!

290
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,750
No, you betrayed
the ancient one.

291
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,000
I will show you
the folly of your decision.

292
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,291
Omnipotent Ashtoor,
power my amulet.

293
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:29,000
Observe, servant of evil,
as the mighty light of Ashtoor

294
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,458
blots out your darkness!

Help me!

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,583
Mordo, you are a fool!

I will help you
attack him through you!

[Dormammu] Now you will know
what true power is, Strange!

I call down

Okay, I've had enough
sitting on the sidelines!

Oh, boy!

You dare to challenge me
in my own dimension?

So be it.

305
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,583
Uh-oh! Maybe this wasn't
such a smart move after all.

I summon

while I go help our friend.

By the Light of Agamotto,

313
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,583
disperse Dormammu's magic!

314
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,583
Spider-Man, we must
get back through the portal
and close it!

315
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,000
[Spider-Man]
I can go along with that!

316
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,625
I control this side
of the portal,

317
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:53,708
and you will not escape!

00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,500
Give it to me!

322
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,875
Go fetch!

323
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:09,958
No!

324
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,625
You'd do well
at the obedience trials,

325
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,125
but you're not very fast.

326
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,333
No!

327
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,208
Daddy!

328
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,000
Are you in here, Daddy?!

329
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,875
No! Your father
isn't really here!

330
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,458
Listen to me!
Mordo tricked you!

331
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,833
I don't believe you!
I have to find him!

332
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,375
Let me handle this.

333
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,333
Mary Jane, you must learn

334
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,875
to face the truth
about your father.

335
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,375
And this house,
it's never clean!

336
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,583
Lousy kids!

337
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,625
Look on your father as he was.

338
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,000
We all have emotional ties
that have been severed

339
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,416
in our lives, and Mordo
knows how to use his magic

340
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,750
to seemingly reconnect them.

341
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,708
[Mordo]
See me as your father.

342
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,833
I suspect that's what
he did to gain power over you.

343
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,291
-You must embrace them.
-[crying]

344
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,333
And let go
of your bitter memories.

345
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,333
You understand?

346
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,458
Excellent.

347
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,583
Is she okay?

348
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,958
She is very well.

349
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,250

[screaming]

351
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,833
We cannot help her now.

352
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,333
Dormammu must be accepted
into our world

353
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,750
by someone who embraces
him, like Mordo.

354
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,458
He will try to trick her
into inviting him.

355
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:26,458
You have come to me, my child.

356
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,708
Stay here,
and we can be together.

357
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,750
You're...

358
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,708
You're not my father!

359
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,708
Why, yes!
Yes, I am, my child!

360
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,583
Come to me.

361
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,500
Trust me. Obey me.

362
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,833
No! No!

363
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,958
This is all wrong!
This is another trick!

364
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,250
You're not my father!
Stay away from me!

365
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,291
Do not reject me!

366
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,250
That is the one thing
you cannot do!

367
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,875
Nooo!

368
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,000

00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,958
Mary Jane,
thank heavens you're back!

371
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,958
[Doctor Strange]
She did it!

372
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:07,083
She had the strength of mind
to see through Dormammu's ruse,

373
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,583
and now I chant
the words to close

374
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:13,458
this portal of evil
once and for all!

375
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:17,875
Tonn konn champon kraa!

-No!

[Wong]
We must go, Doctor!

378
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,250
The fluctuation of
the diminishing portal's energy

379
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,375
is threatening
this entire area!

380
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,750
Yes, Wong. By the power
of the the Vishanti.

Mary Jane, are you okay?

384
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,458
Yes, I'm all right.

385
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,708
I just wanna go home.

386
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,500
To the people who love me.

387
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,375
Thank you, Doctor Strange.

388
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,458
Wong, thank you for everything.

389
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,208
It has been a pleasure fighting
by your side, Spider-Man.

390
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,583
You are a worthy ally
in the battle against darkness.

391
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,833
May the Vishanti
watch over thee.

392
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,750
And may your amulet...
never... tickle.

393
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,416
The Vishanti have
smiled on us,

394
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:03,458
and I hope they will do
the same for Spider-Man
and Mary Jane.

395
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,875
Our work here is now--

396
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:06,875
[Wong] What is it, Doctor?

397
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,958
What's wrong?

398
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,750
[Doctor Strange] I sense
that we are being watched

399
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,000
by someone
whose powers dwarf my own.
