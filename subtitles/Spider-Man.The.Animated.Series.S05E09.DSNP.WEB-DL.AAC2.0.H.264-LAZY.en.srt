Great, now I'm
some kind of pawn

in a galactic game of chess.

171
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,708
My only way out of
this is to bring help,

172
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,875
not only to save this planet

173
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,166
but to fight
The Beyonder as well.

174
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,125
I need to assemble
a team of people

175
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,208
that I know can be
useful to me.

176
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,375
Okay, now...

177
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,458
who's fought that Dr. Doom
guy before and won?

178
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,500
Of course.

179
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,083
Computer, can I transport
to this planet

180
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,458
the Fantastic Four?

181
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,083
Affirmative.

182
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,291
And, there's another
who was a big help to me

183
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,250
against Carnage and Venom.

184
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,458

Affirmative.

186
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,000
And there's only one man
that can fight the Red Skull:

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,166
Captain America.

188
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,583
Affirmative.

There will only
be enough energy

for one last teleportation.

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,166
There's another
team of Superheroes

192
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,708
that I've worked with before.

193

the X-Men.

194

Which one?

195
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,708
Good question.

196
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:18,000
Let's see,
there was one so powerful

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,500
that she could control
the very weather.

198
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,125
She might be a suitable match
for the Beyonder's powers.

199
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:28,000
Computer, bring me
the one called Storm.

200
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,750

00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,625
there's this intergalactic
entity named The Beyonder

255

and he wants to
see who would win

You have to help me.

and figure out how to get home.

265
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,458
The only way The Beyonder
will send us home

266
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,833
is if we free
the people of this planet.

Beyonder you speak of?

this is some

It's no use,
those worms are on their way

338
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,125

tear this place apart.

What are we gonna do?

00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,000
You know, Spider-Man
was telling the truth.

345
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,583
The scientists of this
planet must have made this

346
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:59,083
their last fortress
against the forces of evil.

347
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,500
Those worms would have provided

348
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,291
a natural defensive barrier.

349
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,250
Yeah, not even Doc Doom
would want to rule a land

full of these guys.

351
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,166
If that's the case,

352
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,291
then this lab complex had to
have its own security system.

353
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,416
I can't be certain,

354
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,250
but I think that this dish

355
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,375
might have created a kind
of energy force field,

356
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,708
a protective barrier.

357
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,291
Why did they shut it down?

358
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,875
Maybe this is the answer.

359
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,458
I think it's an energy gauge.

360
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,875
This whole complex
simply ran out of power.

361
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:30,000
My guess is that the Lizard
smashed their power source.

362
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,583
How awful.

363
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,833
You mean the shield
dissipated and they--

364
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:38,208
I can't keep this
up much longer.

365
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,125
We've gotta find
some way to harness

366
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,375
enough power to turn
on the force field.

367
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,958
We can't just get
power out of thin air.

368

Yes, we can.

can harness the elements,

Yes, Spider-Man.

372
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,250
Good! We have to locate
the Sheila generator

373
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,458
and feed a line into it.

I think I can revive him.

There seems to be two different
components to his brain.

389
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:43,000
One part, the savage lizard
part is now unconscious,

390

but the other
has been lying dormant
