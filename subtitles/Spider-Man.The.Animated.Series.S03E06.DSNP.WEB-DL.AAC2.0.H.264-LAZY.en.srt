162
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,333
I didn't know
you were upstairs.

163
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,208
Aren't you home a little early
from your new job?

164
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,708
It's a long story,
but the important thing is,

165
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,125
-are you all right?
-Of course.

166
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,875
Why wouldn't I be?

167
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,958
-[crash]
-[gasps] Oh, dear!

168
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,500
Hold it right there, Parker!

169
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,750
[thinking]
I can't risk a battle here.

170
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,416
Aunt May could get hurt.

171
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,416
We'll see what the police
have to say about this.

172
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,333
Ma'am, we are the police.

173
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,833
Detective Terri Lee, NYPD.

174
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,583
Long time no see, Parker.

175
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,833
Allow me to introduce you
to Federal Agent Susan Choi.

176
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,125
Federal agent?
What do you want with me?

177
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,291
We want that computer disk
for starters.

178
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,291
But it's just diagnostic data.

179
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,166
Oh, really?

180
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,958
I say it's full
of classified defense plans.

181
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,958
We knew somebody
in Fisk's company

182
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,708
was selling government secrets.

183
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,708
Now we've finally
found the traitor-- you.

184
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,500
I don't know
what you're talking about.

185
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,833
I knew nothing about this.

186
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,875
[Choi]
Tell it to the judge.

187
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,583
Read him his rights.

188
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,750
Terri, you know me.
I wouldn't betray my country.

189
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,875
Parker, you better
get yourself a good lawyer.

[Aunt May]
Peter's a good boy!

192
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,291
There's got to be
an explanation!

193
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,500
For his sake,
I hope it's a good one.

194
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,708
[keys jingling]

195
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,125
[guard] Parker,
your lawyer's here.

196
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,291
You're my lawyer?

197
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,875
You sound surprised.

198
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,250
Uh, no, I mean...

199
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,125
I'm sorry.

200
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,458
I've just never met
a blind lawyer before.

201
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,708
Well, I've never met
an accused traitor before,

202
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,291
so we're even.

203
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,583
My name's Murdock.
Matt Murdock.

204
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,333
The famous
criminal defense lawyer?

205
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,250
But I can't afford you.

206
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,000
Well, somebody sent me
a big cash retainer,

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,708
so until it runs out,
I'm your man,

208
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,958
if you want me.

209
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,250
-Of course.
-Good.

210
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,375
They say justice is also blind,

211
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,458
so I like to think it gives me
a leg up on the competition.

212
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,750
Judging from what
you've gotten yourself into,

213
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,166
we're going to need
every bit of help we can get.

214
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,750
First of all, I need answers.

215
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,250
[helicopter whirs]

216
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,458
[Peter]
Up until this moment,

217
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,291
I had precious few to offer.

218
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,583
[thunder crashes]

219
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,875
That's why I've let
these creeps kidnap me.

220
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,958
But have I put myself
in even greater danger
than before?

221
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:35,125
[dramatic music]

222
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,708
Mr. Fisk,
what are you doing here?

223
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:46,250
Someone in my organization
made an awful mistake,

224
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,250
one which might have exposed
me to imminent prosecution.

225
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,833
I needed to find somebody
to take the fall, as they say,

226
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,375
and you are
that unfortunate person.

227
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,125
You're the one who framed me?

228
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,250
Yes, and I engineered
your escape,

229
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,583
so as to leave no doubt
in anyone's mind

230
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,875
that you are guilty.

231
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,750
You and Spider-Man.

232
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,416
Good work, Chameleon.

233
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,166
[Chameleon] My pleasure.

234
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,833
Unfortunately, as I no longer
have use for you,

235
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,416
I must be leaving.

236
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,750
Oh, please note,
not even your friend Spider-Man

237
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,875
could break out of this cell.

238
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,583

There's no
air vent in here!

241
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,875
[Richard, on speaker] Note also
that you have only enough air

242
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,833
to last a few minutes.

243
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,500
Goodbye, Parker.

244
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,708
Goodbye forever.

[panting]

246
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,833
Not much air left.

247
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,083
Fisk was right about this door.

248
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,083
Spider-Man can't move it!

249
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,250

My father, the Kingpin,
will be pleased.

00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,708
We've saved him
from federal prosecution.

255
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:08,625
How ironic that Parker
should be branded a traitor,

256
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,875
especially after what you've
told us about his parents.

Who are you?

Let's go.

Me.

There's two men at the far end
of the roof, behind the sign.

One's out of shape,

give my spider-sense

you've been framed.

You'll be safe here
until he can prove it.

290

Hold it, where are you going?

and there's work to be done.

like my friend Daredevil?

Well, there's one thing
I'm still curious about.

00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,125
Why am I helping you?

298
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,708
Maybe it's because
I know what it's like

Dad's time in the ring
was over,

but he had a kid to support,

307
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,125
so he took a job
collecting money

308
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,208
for an up-and-coming mobster
and sold his soul.

[Matt] I couldn't deal

00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,875
of what I'd seen my dad doing.

It was against the law to
transport it through the city.

Someone didn't
care about the law,

or about broken lives,

That someone was a crime boss
who calls himself the Kingpin.

He was on his way
to the police when--

[loud crash]

328
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,708
My dad was never seen again.

Do you know
who this Kingpin guy is?

330
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,083
I have my suspicions,

331
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,833
but since I have no evidence,

332
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,375
it's better I keep
my suspicions to myself.

333
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,583
But you think Richard Fisk
is working for him?

334
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,833
Yes, I'm sure of it.

335
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,000
The Kingpin's a dangerous man.

336
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
His influence is far-reaching,

337
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,125
but someday,
he'll meet his match.

338

Someday soon.

00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,000
But I do go on.

340

You could probably
use some rest.

Thanks, Matt, for everything.

343

But there's
no rest for Spider-Man.

I could have told you

it confused me.

352
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:55,333
Then I met a mysterious man
named Stick.

353
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,958
I wish the world could
know about all the effort,

354
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,708
all the long hours where Stick

355
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,583
took a lost
and lonely blind kid

356
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,708
and taught me to see in ways
I never knew existed.

357
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,500
That accident had changed me.

358

Was it the radiation?
Does it matter?

my greatest enemy.

Why, Anna Watson,
you're being so kind,
