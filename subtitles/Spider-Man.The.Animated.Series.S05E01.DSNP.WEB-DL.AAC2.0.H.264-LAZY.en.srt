Dr. Kafka says
I should have plenty of rest,

00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,291
I was once your father.

164
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,000
It wouldn't do to cut
me out of your life.

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,250
I didn't want you in my head.

166
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,833
I didn't need you until now.

167
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,583
Now I need you!

168
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,458
[Peter]
I don't get it.

169
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,458
Wilson Fisk, Spider-Man's
enemy, wants to see me?

170
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:39,375
Ah, Mr. Parker,
how good of you to join me.

171
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,000
[Peter] No spider-sense,
no danger.

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I read about your impending
marriage to Miss Watson,

173
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,416
and, frankly,

174
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,625
-I can't let you do it.
-What?!

175
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,583
That is why
I have taken the liberty

176
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:57,083
of arranging the details myself.

177
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,458
Why would you do that for me?

178
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,875
You forget
that you once saved my life.

179
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,625
People expect
no less from Wilson Fisk,

180
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:09,000
and, besides, it is good
publicity for a newspaper

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,458
that I have just acquired,
the Daily Beacon.

182
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,291
-Smile.
-[click]

183
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,875
I've been scooped
by the competition.

184
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,458
I don't believe it.

185
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,750
Parker, how could
you do this to me?!

186
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,833
I'm sure Peter didn't know Fisk
had bought a rival newspaper.

187
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,416
No, I swear, I--

188
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,458
It's bad enough
Fisk thinks he can beat me

189
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,458
at my own newspaper game,
but to out-scoop me

190
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:35,166
using my own employees,
I don't think so.

191
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,416
I wanna give Parker
a wedding that'll make

192
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,875
that Princess Di thing
look like a clam bake.

193
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,458
You do?

194
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,708
Yes, nothing personal,
but between Fisk and me,

195
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,208
this wedding business is war!

196
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,708
Oh, fine.

197
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,500
And don't worry
about paying me back.

198
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,375
You can work it off
over the next decade or two.

199
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,083
Huh? But--

200
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:01,958
Lori, get me that snake
in the grass, Wilson Fisk.

201
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,000
Parker, haven't
you got work to do?

202
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,250
[Kingpin] J. Jonah Jameson,
my new business rival.

203
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,000
What can I do for you?

204
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,500
Fisk, Peter Parker's
like a son to me.

205
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,250
I've been planning
his wedding for weeks.

206
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,250
It was going to be a surprise.

207
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,291
I've already hired
the top florist in Manhattan.

208
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,708
[Kingpin]
I'm having roses imported

209
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,750
from Ecuador on my private jet.

210
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,000
[Peter]
Unbelievable.

211
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,291
[Jonah]
What about the cake?

212
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,333
I know
the top pastry chef in Queens.

213
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:36,250
[Kingpin] And I know
the Queen's top pastry chef.

214
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,208
[grunting]

215
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,458
[Green Goblin laughing]

216
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,375
You've forgotten, boy,
that you've got

217
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,375
the power of the Green Goblin.

218
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,458
Osborn, what's going on in here?

219
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,291
Oof! [groans]

220
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,083
[Green Goblin laughing]

221
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,625
Well done, my son.

222
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,416
[laughing]

223
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,333
You're free!

224
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,083
[Harry] Thanks to you.

225
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,333
You must teach me again
how to be the Green Goblin.

226
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:16,291
Oh, I have
big plans for you,

227
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:20,583
but first you must forge
another important partnership!

228
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,208
This partnership
will be of great benefit

229
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,625
to us all, Mr. Smythe.

230
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,958
My employer, Silvermane,
only makes alliances

231
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,708
to become stronger.

232
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,875
I will retain ownership
of the company,

233
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:37,083
but Silvermane will control
the daily operations.

234
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,083
Very good, but it does come
as rather a shock

235
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,500
that you are the Green Goblin.

236
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Well, it was
no less shocking for me

237
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,625
to learn of Silvermane's battle
against Wilson Fisk,

238
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,583
the criminal known
as the Kingpin.

239
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,583
How did you find out?

240
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,875
I was told
by the same third party

241
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,875
who brought us together.

242
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,458
He wishes to remain anonymous.

243
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,583
No matter. With Oscorp's
manufacturing capabilities

244
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:06,583
and my technology, Silvermane
now has the extra muscle

245
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,875
he needs to take on the Kingpin.

246
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,583
And speaking of muscle,
Scorpion,

247
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,625
is your suit
functioning properly?

248
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,625
You fixed it real good,
Mr. Smythe.

249
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,208
Meet my new assistant.

250
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,250
I thought he would prove
useful to you.

251
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,708
He can be the point man
for this army of robots

252
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,583
you are going to build for me!

253
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,208
Can you begin right away?

254
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,500
As promised, but why
in such force so quickly?

255
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,333
Like Silvermane,
I too have a powerful enemy,

256
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:36,083
and I won't stop until he's
reduced to a whimpering heap!

257
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,333
[welding torch buzzing]

258
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,000
Finished.

259
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,125
I call it
the Goblin Robo Warrior.

260
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm not interested
in your dramatic flair

261
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,708
for names, Smythe.

262
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,625
Can it do the job?

263
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,958
Please observe.

264
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,083
What one can't do, many can.

265
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,458
[laughing]

266
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,583
Excellent! Excellent!

267
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,083
[Peter] I really wanna thank you
for being my best man, Robbie.

268
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,333
I always thought
Harry would do this,

269
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,875
but with him ill
and now missing--

270

I understand, Peter.

You've got the rings, don't you?

272
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,291
I do unless they jumped out

273
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,958
since you asked me
two minutes ago.

274

I wanna get a seat up front.

You look great.
Where have you been?

-In Europe, overseeing
my mother's business.

[Flash] Hey, look.

281
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,750
Huh. Now that's
what I call style.

282
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,708
-Indeed.
-Hmph!

283
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:37,416
Smythe, this army
of robots is excellent.

284
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,750
They're all programmed
to obey your every command.

285
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,208
Then my first command is
let's go attend a wedding!

286
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,375
-A wedding?
-Follow me!

[playing classical music]

288
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,875
We are gathered here
today to unite these two

00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,833
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

These robots are obviously
the work of Alistair Smythe.

If he and Silvermane
are allied with Osborn,

339

it poses a serious threat
to my business.

Do you take Mary Jane Watson
to be your wedded wife?

I do!

And do you take this man
to be your wedded husband?

She does!

I don't have time for this.

with you again.

Stay back, or I'll

Harry, if you
really love Mary Jane,

you must let her go.

Oh, really?

00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,583
Suppose I'd rather destroy her

than see her
in the arms of my archenemy?

00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,500
Harry, you think
you know who your enemies are,

374
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,875
but aren't you forgetting
who your friends are?

375
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,125
-Liz?
-Deep down, you must know

376
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,500
that you and Mary Jane
aren't meant to be.

377
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,375
She loves Peter,
but that doesn't mean

378
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,000
that she won't
always be your friend.

379

No! You're confusing me!

The Green Goblin
is my only friend!

You're wrong, Harry!
I'm your friend,

and I was hoping that some day,
we'd be more than friends.

You-- You love me?

Yes, but if we're
to have a future together,

then it has to begin now.

like to go home and--

No way. I'm late enough
for my wedding as it is.
