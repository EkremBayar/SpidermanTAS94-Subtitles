00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,875
at the count of three

170
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,166
I will snap my fingers

171
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,500
and you must wake up.

172
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,208
You'll feel refreshed

173
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,416
and you'll remember
everything you've told me.

174
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,958
-One, two, three.
-[snaps fingers]

[gasps]

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,458
Oh, Peter.

177
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,291
You did well.

178
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,375
Those dream images may be
clues to your disappearance.

179
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,000
And we're gonna
track down every one

180
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,833
until we figure all this out.

181
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,875
[dramatic music playing]

182
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,250
[water splashing]

183
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:43,166
Professor, I never had this
much trouble reforming before.

184
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,333
I feel terrible.

185
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,291
Why is this happening to me?

186
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,250
I can't really say,
my dear boy.

187
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,375
Your constitution is still,

188
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:54,833
well, experimental
at this point.

189
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,375
I'll need to run a few tests.

190
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,583
It's going to take some time.

191
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,416
No! I can't wait!

192
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,875
Mary Jane is--

193
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,208
Mary Jane is not
important right now.

194
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,375
I must take time to
examine your blood sample.

195
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,958
And leave her in the
arms of Peter Parker?

196
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,125
Not a chance!

197
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,500
Sharp, come back!

198
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:21,583
Yes Anna, I have heard from
Peter and Mary Jane today.

199
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm supposed
to keep it a secret

200
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,166
but they might go visit
the George Washington Bridge.

201
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:31,000
No, I haven't any idea why.

202
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,375
[Peter] Is this bringing
back any memories, M.J?

203
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,750
Any small clue?

204
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,000
[Mary Jane] I was on the ship

205
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,750
before I fell off this bridge.

206
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,750
-The pirate ship?
-Yes.

207
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,000
On the Hudson River?

208
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,416
Yes.

209
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,750
Oh, I know
what you're thinking.

210
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,291
It makes no sense at all.

211
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,500
But I-- [gasps]

212
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,458
Mary Jane.
What's the matter?

213
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:54,000
I suddenly felt really spacey.

214
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
As if I can't hold
my thoughts together.

215
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,625
It's probably the shock

216
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,416
of being back here
where it all started.

217
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,500
I remember suddenly
finding myself

218
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,291
at the bottom of the bridge

219
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,833
and seeing Spider-Man
battling the Green Goblin.

220
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,833
But I don't remember
falling off

221
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,458
or anything that
happened in between.

222
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,333
Oh, I hate this bridge.

223
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,375
Yeah, me too.

224
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,708
I always get the feeling

225
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,416
something bad is
going to happen here.

226
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,416
[Morrie] Kid,
you oughta become a psychic.

227
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,000
-Morrie!
-Stay back.

228
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,583
I don't know who's
more of a pain.

229
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,416
You or Spider-Man.

230
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,375
[Mary Jane screams]

231
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,458
Now then, we're together again.

232
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,375
Just the way I like it.

233
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,708
After all, we were
made for each other.

234
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,375

235

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,458
Bench!

237
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,458
No.

238
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,125
[dramatic music playing]

239
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,375
Mary Jane.

240
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,833
Where is she?

241
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,375
They could be miles away.

242
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,583
My only chance of
getting Mary Jane back

243
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,416
is to keep following
the clues from her dream.

244
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:12,083
Somehow I think all the
answers will lead to Bench.

245
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,583
But where on earth am
I going to find a pirate ship?

246
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,708
Of course.

247
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,083
A theme restaurant.

248
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,500
[gentle music playing]

249
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Well, hello Smiley.

250
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,250
I'm sorry sir.

251
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,833
A tie and jacket are
required after 5:00 pm.

252
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,500
[Peter] I'm not here for
the chicken a la Davy Jones.

253
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,458
I'm looking for
a woman whose life

254
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,833
may be in serious danger.

255
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,708
Oh yes, that poor child.

256
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,458
I was terribly
worried about her.

257
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:44,208
She appeared one night
and seemed very disoriented.

258
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,333
She was soaking wet
but it wasn't raining.

259
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,458
She said she wanted to go home

260
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,250
but I told her
you can't go home, dear.

261
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,750
Not until we get you
into some dry clothes.

262
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,291
I went back to see if we had

263
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,458
anything for her in
the coat check room.

264
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,250
And when I returned,
she was gone.

265
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,458
[Peter] Which way
did she come from?

266
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,458
From North, up the street.

267
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,583
[Peter] Thanks!

268
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:13,583
The bridge, the pirate ship,
the man with the mustache.

269
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,458
They're all real.

270
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,958
But what's next?

271
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,833
Hey, [sniffs] that
smells like cake baking.

272
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,625
[Mary Jane] I smell
something baking in an oven.

273
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,875
Wait a minute.

274
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,833
A wedding cake bakery?

275
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,166
Of course.

Mary Jane wearing
a wedding dress

and falling in goo.

278
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:42,708
It must be a dream image
inspired by these cakes.

279
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,458
[Mary Jane] I'm being
chased by a clown.

280
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,500
[Peter] A clown who
bangs a tin drum.

281
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,708
What could that be?

282
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,291
A circus?

283
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,875
A toy.

Hello.

286
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,583
This might be what
I'm looking for.

287
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,416
Now what?

288

This is the one time
batteries not included

291
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,958
wouldn't have been a bad idea.

292
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,583
But why do I get the feeling

293
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,458
that Alistair Smythe
is now in the toy business?

294
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,750
Uh-oh.

There's something back there.

298
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,250
Gotta move fast.

299
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,583
Thank you.

300
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,625
Oscorp?

301
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,000
What on earth is this?

302
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Uh-oh, I'm outta here.

[wheels rattling]

304

The sound it's making

305
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,291
is what Mary Jane heard.

306
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm on the right track.

307
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,083
Literally.

I hope he only bought

Now where am I?

That light at the
end of the tunnel.

313
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,166
Could that be the big eye
Mary Jane saw in her dream?

314
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,583
This tunnel.

315
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,250
It's like the one
leading from Oscorp

316
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,708
to the Green Goblin's
underwater lab.

317
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,333
I thought I destroyed that lab.

318
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,000
But maybe somebody's
brought it back to life.

319

to see this lab again, Red.

00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,291
I remember this place.

What does it have
to do with you?

Like I've been saying
all along, Red.

329

We were made for each other.

Don't you understand?

You have no choice
but to be mine.

I can't stand looking at you.

334
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,625
[yelps]

335
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,458
And let's not bring up
your personality.

336
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,000
I knew I could count
on you to find me.

337
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
-[water crashing]
-[Mary Jane screaming]

338
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,583
Why can't I get rid of you?

339
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,000
Mary Jane is mine.

340
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,875
[Peter] My suit, it's torn.

341
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,000
Mary Jane.

342
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,416
I can't reassemble myself.

343
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:53,000
I won't let you
terrorize me any longer.

344
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,083
Stop!

345
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,333
Please, stop!

346
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,458
I can't do it.

347
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,250
I can't destroy him.

348
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,875
Those water powers.

349
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,875
How do you even make
them happen at all?

350
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,958
I can answer that Spider-Man.

351
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,333
Who are you?

352
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,458
My name is Professor
Miles Warren

353
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,500
and I can actually
be considered

354
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,708
Mary Jane's father.

355
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,291
Miles Warren.

356
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,000
I read about you
in a science journal.

357
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,125
Your cloning experiments were
banned by the government.

358
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,833
True.

359
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,000
So I found it necessary
to continue my research

360
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
in secret on an
underground level.

361
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,458
Fortunately, there are
those who are willing

362
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:34,000
to pay for scientific
work like mine.

363
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You're the one
who kept me here.

364
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,750
You gave me the power
to turn into water.

365
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,458
You have hydropower
because you and Hydro-Man

366
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,958
literally were made
for each other.

367
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,333
[Peter] What do you mean?

368
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,083
Perhaps it's best

369
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,125
if I explain everything
from the beginning.

370
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,875
I was set up in this lab

371
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,083
by an individual
who wished for me

372
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,000
to continue my research.

373
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,208
[Peter] Who?

374
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,291
He prefers to remain anonymous.

375
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,083
My early experiments
were unsuccessful.

376
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,000
The tissue wouldn't
hold together.

377
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,833
Then I happened upon an
article in the Daily Bugle

378
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,958
about Hydro-Man and
his viscous ability

379
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,000
to disassemble and
reassemble himself.

380
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,125
This might hold the key.

381
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:23,250
But Hydro-Man
evaporated on a rooftop.

382
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,291
[water splashing]

383
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,375
[Miles] So I had
read in the paper.

384
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,000
However, I hoped
there would still be

385
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
traces of his DNA at
the scene of his demise.

386
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,166
[Peter] And were there?

387
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,291
[Miles] Yes.

388
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,125
Enough to make a clone.

389
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,500
He was magnificent.

390
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,083
An exact duplicate
in looks, ability,

391
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,000
but also, unfortunately,
in memory and emotion.

392
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,291
[Mary Jane] Emotion?

393
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,958
[Peter] Are you
saying the clone

394
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,166
loved Mary Jane as much
as the real Hydro-Man?

395
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,375
[Miles] Exactly.

396
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,958
He threatened to destroy me

397
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,458
if I didn't help him find her.

398
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,458
I told him it was impossible.

399
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,708
Mary Jane was gone.

400
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,875
Hydro-Man was so
devastated by her loss

401
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,708
he insisted that I clone her.

402
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,416
[Mary Jane] How?

403
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,833
[Miles] All I needed was
a sample of your hair.

404
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,833
[Anna crying]

405
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,000
I fused the viscous properties

406
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,833
from Hydro-Man's cell structure

407
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:28,458
to Mary Jane's DNA to
insure the same stability.

408
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,166
It worked beautifully.

409
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,750
But just
as Hydro-Man's emotions

410
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,166
remained true to the original,

411
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,833
so did Mary Jane's.

412
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,458
She felt love.

413
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,583
Love for Peter Parker.

414
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,708
Peter, I've come back to you.

415
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,833
Mary Jane.

416
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,875
-[people cheering]
-[man] Hurray!

417
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,083
Hey!

418
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,583
[Miles] We had no
idea where she'd gone

419
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,375
until we read of
her marriage to Parker.

420
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,958
So what you're trying
to tell me

421
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,166
is I'm not the real Mary Jane?

422
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,083
I'm afraid that is so, my dear.

423
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,708
I would've come for you sooner

424
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,708
but I had to wait until
my powers grew stronger.

425
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,000
You're my Eve, Mary Jane.

426
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,291
You were made from
part of me for me.

427
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,416
[Peter] What?

428
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,708
I don't believe any of this.

429
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:20,958
It's not true.

430
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,291
It can't be true.

431
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,708
Oh, you know in
your heart it is.

432
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,291
You can feel it.

433
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,458
Why didn't you just
tell me I was a clone?

434
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,250
Because if you didn't know,

435
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,208
you'd be just like
the real Mary Jane.

436
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,166
How can I live
my life as a clone?

437
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,291
As a part of you?

438
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,708
I hate you!

439
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,583
Then you're just
gonna have to hate me

440
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,833
for all eternity

441
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,500
as my wife.

I'm afraid I have

00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,958
some rather unpleasant news.

445
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,333
The latest blood
test on Hydro-Man

446
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,083
show that the cloning process

447
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,875
has proven unstable.

448
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,375
You're coming apart just
like my first clones.

449
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,416
It has just taken longer
to happen this time.

450
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,083
According to my research,

451
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,875
neither of you
has much time left.

If you couldn't
do it correctly,

that I have been preparing
you this long while

499
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,416
for the most important
battle of your life?

500
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,250
[Peter] I remember
all of my encounters

501
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,416
with you Madame Web.

502
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,250
I want nothing to do with you.

503
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,291
But suppose I told you

504
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,583
I know where Mary Jane is?

505
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,583
And you will only find her

506
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,708
if you do as I command.

507
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,500
Leave me alone!

508
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,083
I cannot.

509
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,083
This is your
destiny, Spider-Man.

510
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:41,375
And now, the fate of mankind
rests on your weary shoulders.
