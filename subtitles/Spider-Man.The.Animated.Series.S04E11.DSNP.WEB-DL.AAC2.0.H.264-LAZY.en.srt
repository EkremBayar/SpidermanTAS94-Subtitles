Ice had his rules,
Spider-Man had his.

161
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,291
When was I gonna lay down mine?

162
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,458
All that kept runnin'
through my head

163
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,708
was what Ice had said to me.

164
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:06,375
"Whoever has the power
makes the rules."

165
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,625
I was gonna have plenty
of time to think things over,

166
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,125
or so I thought.

167
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,708
[clattering]

168
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,583
Friend of yours?

169
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,291
Just the competition.

170
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,583
My father has many enemies.

171
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,750
Who's your father?

172
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,083
Someone who'll be interested

173
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,875
in knowing what you did for me.

174
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,625
Yeah, that and a token'll
get me a ride on the subway.

175
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:35,000
Knowing my father gets you
more than that, my friend.

176
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,125
You'll see,
he has a lot of power.

177
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,208
[Hobie]
I didn't believe him at all.

178
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,416
But then odd things
started to happen.

179
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,333
Somebody hired
a slick uptown lawyer for me.

180
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,500
He told the judge
that there was no proof
I'd broken parole,

181
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
and since Spider-Man
wasn't aroundto testify,

182
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,583
the law had to let me go.
He won!

183
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,875
Somebody was
on my side that day,

184
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:59,000
and I wanted to see
what else they could do for me.

185
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:05,000
So, you're the man I owe
for my son's well-being.

186
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,333
I-- I had no idea he was
the son of the Kingpin.

187
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,708
I always make good
on my debts, Mr. Brown.

188
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,208
Name your price.

189
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,208
Gold, jewels?

190
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,708
-Power.
-Ah, that.

191
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,000
There's this guy in
my neighborhood named Iceberg.

192
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,333
I want to stick it
to him once and for all.

193
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,708
I see.

194
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,583
That is
an intriguing proposition.

195
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,875
Let me show you my latest toy.

196
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,875
I call it
the stealth battle suit.

197
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,333
Cool Halloween costume.
Does it do anything?

198
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,583
This suit is bulletproof.

199
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,333
It is capable of
pneumatically controlled flight.

200
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,958
It has titanium steel appendages

201
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,458
that facilitate climbing
and offensive maneuvers.

202
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,125
It has rocket-powered blasters

203
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,833
that fire
powerful projectiles at will.

204
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:55,708
In short, the wearer of this
Halloween costume would gain--

205
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,375
Instant power.

206
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,750
It is yours for the asking.

207
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,416
Mine?

208
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,166
What's the catch?

209
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,708
You saved my son.

210
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,833
This is a small price to pay.

211
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,750
Go on, you did ask for power.

212
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,708
Yes, power.

213
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,083
[dramatic music]

214
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,208
[whirring, beeping, and buzzing]

215
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,458
[powering down]

216
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,416
This suit is incredible!

217
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,166
We're even now, right?

218
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,000
Your son's life for the suit,
no strings attached.

219
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,750
No strings.

220
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,750
[laughing maniacally]

221
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,833
No strings.

222
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,500
Funny how you always hear that
from the guys pulling them.

223
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,083
I decided to test out
the Kingpin's present

224
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,583
in an old abandoned building
where no one would get hurt.

225
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,708
The force was astounding.

226
00:09:58,708 --> 00:09:59,958
[clang]

227
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,000
The strength was incredible.

228
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,291
I could go anywhere,
do anything.

229
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,708
I wasn't weak like Hobie Brown.

230
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,750
I was somebody new.

231
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,458
I needed a new name.

232
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,875
I felt like a wild animal
on the prowl,

233
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,166
so I decided to call myself
the Prowler.

234
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:27,125
The balance of power
in New York City
had finally shifted,

235
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,375
to me.

236
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,458
Now it's my turn!

237
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,708
Your fancy suit
doesn't impress me!

238
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm gonna rip it to shreds
with you in it!

239
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,416
-[Prowler] I don't think so!
-[groaning]

240
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,708
-[gasps]
-[crunch]

241
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,875
That's impossible.

242
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,083
I'm stronger than you!

243
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,125
Your freak genes
don't cut it anymore,

244
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,875
not when the Prowler's
on your tail.

245
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,708
-The Prowler, huh?
-You!

246
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,291
Catchy name, but just who are
you when you're at home?

247
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,291
-[grunting]
-Nice claws.

248
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,416
You ever hang out
with my friend Wolverine?

249
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,875
You won't take me again!

250
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,208
Again?
I've met you before?

251
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,458
No answer, huh?
No matter.

252
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,000
I've gotta take him
where he can't hurt anyone else.

253
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,708
[tingle]

254
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,958
[coughing]

255
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,458
See how you like my web!

256
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,416
[Hobie] I had done it.

257
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,875
I'd beaten Iceberg and
Spider-Man both in one night.

258
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,458
I was the Prowler.

259
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,458
[Hobie]
Spider-Man was destroyed,

260
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,166
or so I thought.

261
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,125
Maybe I'll never know
what happened to him next.

262
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,208
I know what happened
next all too well,

263
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,750
though I can't tell him.

264
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,416
[straining] Need air!

265
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,625
Got to summon all my strength!

[gasping]

267
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,291
I got out of that one
just by the skin of my teeth.

268
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,583
[Hobie]
Parker, I thought I was it.

269
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:29,958
All I had to do was officially
take the reins of power.

270
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,583
-[alarm blaring]
-[monitors zapping]

271
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,333
No! No!

272
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,708
Iceberg,
time to cash that check

273
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,250
your mouth's been writing.

274
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,250
Men, hold your fire.

275
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,583
Allow me.

276
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,875
[laughing]

277
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,458
Forgot to tell you,

278
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,416
this suit has
its own nuclear heating unit.

279
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,083
Now where were we?

280
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,583
[confused chatter]

281
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,291
[Hobie]
I wanted Iceberg's operation.

282
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,583
-Now I had it.
-Who is this guy, anyway?

283
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,875
-Where's Iceberg?
-[claps] Iceberg.

284
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,625
Yes?

285
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,875
See if our guests would
like anything cold to drink.

286
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,750
[shocked murmuring]

287
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,875
Gentlemen, ladies, a toast--
to the new order.

288
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,416
-[zapping]
-Ohh! Ahh!

00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,208
Stay away!

291
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,291
What's wrong with it?

-[zapping]
-[groans]

00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,833
My goodness,
is something the matter?

295
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:35,000
The suit, it's hurting me!
You have to fix it!

296
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,875
First, Kingpin doesn't
have to do anything.

297
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,458
Second, I forgot to give
you one little warning

298
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,583
about my toy--
batteries are not included.

299
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,416
What?!
You have to come to me

300
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,083
to get it recharged,

301
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,250
and I'm having the suit
give you sporadic jolts

302
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:55,833
of electricity to hasten
your return, like so.

303
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:59,208
You see, Prowler,
I now control you.

304
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:02,000
You are mine.

305
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,375
You said no strings!

306
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,416
The best puppeteers
never use strings.

307
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,458
I wouldn't take that
off if I were you.

308
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,000
The suit includes
a self-destruct device.

309
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,583
It might turn your neighborhood
into an ash heap.

310
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,083
Why would you do this to me?

311
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,708
I saved your son!

312
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,708
And I gave you what you wanted.

313
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:23,000
You wanted to defeat Iceberg
and have power over him.

314
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,250
Now you do.

315
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,208
For years,
he has worked for me,

316
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:30,458
but, lately, he was getting
a little hard to control.

317
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,375
When you came to me
wanting to topple him,

318
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,291
it fit in perfectly
with my plans.

319
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,208
[laughing]

He wants to be my husband.

He works a normal job,

No. You still think power
is the only solution.

If power isn't important,

-Because I need Spider-Man.
-What?

I saw on the news
that he was alive.

He must've survived
my attack after all.

Now he's the only guy
I know who's strong enough

to help me face off
against the Kingpin,

356
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,875
and I'm gonna make you tell me
where Spider-Man is,

357
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,416
or force him to come here
to save your life.

I need him. Oh, the pain!

You could start
by saying please.

363

Bad news is there's no way
to get you out of it

any good news?

There's a slight chance
that I can reroute

367
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,500
the energy charges that Kingpin
is sending to hurt you.

368
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,208
That can be used to power
some of the suit's functions.

-Not for long, though.
-What good would that do me?

00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,708
Well, if the Kingpin
is expecting you to be weak,

371
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,000
then you'll have a trick
up your sleeve, won't you?

372
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,583
One that maybe
you and Spider-Man can use

373
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,000
to your advantage.

374

You'd call Spider-Man for me?
