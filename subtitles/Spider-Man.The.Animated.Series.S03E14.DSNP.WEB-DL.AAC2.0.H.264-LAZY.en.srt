Put 'er there.

168
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,458
Osborn's never been
this friendly to me before.

169
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,708
His grip,
it's getting tighter!

170
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:11,000
He'd break my hand
if not for my spider-strength.

171
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,625
[Norman]
Oh, I'm sorry, Peter.

172
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,250
Was I squeezing too tightly?

173
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,875
I forgot how delicate you are.

174
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,458
Dinner is ready to be served!

175
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:25,000
I hope you enjoy the stew.

176
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,750
It's almost as if
he knows I'm Spider-Man.

177
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,083
-[dramatic music]
-But how could he?

178
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,708
I understand you're seeing
Mary Jane now, Peter.

179
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,875
I'll bet you two
have been conspiring

180
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,458
to get together for some time.

181
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,000
Uh, Mr. Osborn,
you've got it all wrong.

182
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,833
You know,
I saw another one

183
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,958
of your spectacular
Spider-Man photos in the Bugle.

184
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:50,875
How do you get
those fantastic angles?

185
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,208
Mr. Osborn,
Peter never gives out

186
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,958
his treasured trade secrets.

187
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,875
Not even to me!

188
00:07:56,875 --> 00:08:01,000
You know, Harry,
your friend and I
share a little secret.

189
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,375
Don't we, Pete?

190
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,250
Tiger, what is
he talking about?

191
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,500
I-- I wish I knew!

192
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,125
Maybe we should let
your friends in on our secret.

193
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,500
Over dessert, perhaps?

194
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,458
He does know I'm Spider-Man!

195
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,958
But how?!

196
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,875
Uh, will you excuse me
for a moment?

197
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,458
Make sure
it's only a moment, Pete!

198
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,333
The party's just begun.

199
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,833
I've gotta do something
before Osborn flips out

200
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,208
and reveals my identity.

201
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,875
I need a little diversion.

202
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,125
I've got it!

203
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,708
Maybe if I heat up
the chemicals
in my web cartridges,

204
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,875
that might do the trick!

205
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,500
Sorry, I, uh...

206
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,000
I felt a little ill
for a moment.

207
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Only a little?

208
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So, just what was this secret

209
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,166
you were talking about,
Mr. Osborn?

210
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,708
Peter, I think it's time
we shared our little secret.

211
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,375
-[explosion]
-[Debra] It's a fire!

212
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,083
[Peter]
Outside, quickly!

213
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,875
[man] Fire!

214
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:56,375
Party's over, but
I still owe Osborn a dance!

215
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,333
Peter, where are you going?!

216
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,708
Mr. Osborn's still in there!

217
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,125
I've gotta save him!

218
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,416
No! You can't!

219
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,625
Dad!

220
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,875
-[spider-sense tingling]
-Parker!

221
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,833
you've been a thorn
in my side for too long!

222
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,500
You pestered me as Spider-Man!

223
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,458
[moaning]

224
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,333
[as Norman]
You hurt my son
as Peter Parker.

225
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,875
[moaning]

226
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,083
[maniacal laughter]

227
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,500
Well, it all ends tonight!

228
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,208
[glider whooshing]

229
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,291
I don't have
my web-shooters on!

230
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,583
Problems, Parker?

231
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,333
-Uh-oh!
-[explosions]

232
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,750
It's a good thing nobody can
see us here in the backyard.

233
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,583
I guess clothes
really do make the man!

234
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,875
[groaning]

235
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,375
It's some kind
of super hard metal.

236
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,000
I can't break it!

237
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And away

238
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,625
we go!

239
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,083
-[maniacal laughter]
-[intense dramatic music]

240
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,625
[Peter]
Madame Web was right.

241
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,125
The monster with two heads,

242
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,208
two identities, has struck!

243
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,416
I've never been
so vulnerable before!

244
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,625
Awake down there?

245
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,000
As befits an adversary
of your caliber,

246
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,375
I'm granting you
a demise with dignity!

247
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,250
Just keep talking, Osborn.

248
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,708
I need the time!

249
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,416
You'll have
a burial at sea, Parker!

250
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,875
Isn't that charming?

251
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,458
[Peter] Gotta get
to my web-shooter!

252
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,250
Did it!

253
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,000
Norman would be so proud of me.

254
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,625
He'll never believe
how easy this was!

255
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,166
Believe this!
Huh?!

256
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,875
If this is going to work,
I can't be a millimeter off!

257
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,125
What?!

258
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,291
No!

259
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,166
Now let's try this
little tango again, shall we?

260
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,166
-[dramatic music]
-[Green Goblin groans]

261
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,375
I underestimated him.

262
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,125
Time for Plan B.

263
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,708
The Time Dilation Accelerator!

264
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,583
He must've miniaturized it!

265
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,500
[warping sound]

266
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,208
I'll bet he used it
to spy on me

267
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,333
to find out I'm Spider-Man!

268
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,416
You know, Parker,

269
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,625
I don't think
I've made you suffer enough!

270
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,458
You've been a guest at my home,

271
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:19,250
and now it's high time
I visited yours!

272
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,083
No!
He's going after Aunt May!

273
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,208
With Ohn's technology,

274
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,416
that psychopath can be in
Forest Hills in micro-seconds!

275
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,500
I'll never reach
Aunt May in time!

276
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,958
[Mary Jane]
So, when the firemen came out,

277
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,583
they said all they found
was something strange

278
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,333
smoldering in the fireplace.

279
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,958
And Mr. Osborn?

280
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,125
We figured Peter
took him to a doctor.

281
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,333
But why wouldn't he call?

282
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,333
Oh, that's Peter Parker
all over!

283
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,291
Thoughtless and irresponsible!

284
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:51,125
Ah, if I didn't like May Parker
as much as I do--

285
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,708
You're wrong about Peter,
Aunt Anna!

286
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,250
He's wonderful.

287
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,291
I love him!

288
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,000
Aunt May!

289
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,458
If he's hurt her...

290
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,875
[intense dramatic music]

291
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,458
No spider-sense.

292
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,708
Does that mean
he's already been here

293
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,708
and gone?

294
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,000
She's okay.
I thought for sure--

295
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
[spider-sense tingling]

296
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,458
Shh!

297
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:16,708
She's sleeping so peacefully,
I couldn't disturb her.

298
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:21,208
I think I'd rather pay a visit
to your other co-conspirator!

299
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,875
[evil chuckle]

300
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,625
Nighty-night, Parker!

301
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,708
What is it?!
Who's there?!

302
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,083
It's just me, Aunt May.

303
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,375
I thought I'd
better check on you.

304
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,458
Oh, Peter.

305
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,875
Thank heavens!

306
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,333
I must've been
having a nightmare.

307
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,625
Did you have fun
at Harry's party?

308
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,375
Well, the party's
still going on.

309
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,708
Oh, how nice for Harry.

310
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,000
Good night, dear.

311
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,166
Sweet dreams, Aunt May.

312
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,458
Another of my co-conspirators?

313
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,000
Who could that nutcase mean?

314
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,625
[Norman] I'll bet you two
have been conspiring

315
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,458
to get together for some time.

316
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,416
Mary Jane!

317
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,833
Osborn accused us of
conspiring to get together.

318
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,875
She's the Goblin's
next target!

319
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,000
I still say
you're asking for trouble

320
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,458
by dating
that strange young man.

321
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,708
Lady, you don't
know the half of it!

322
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,000
[Mary Jane
and Aunt Anna scream]

323
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,333
Run, Aunt Anna, run!

324
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,833
[coughing]

325
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,291
The Goblin's Knockout Gas!

326
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,458
She's okay, just stunned.

327
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,708
-But where's Mary Jane?
-[maniacal laughter]

328
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,958

00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,583
Don't you ever,

499
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,833
ever,

500
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,583
enter my life again!

501
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,333
Do you hear me?!

502
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,875
Do you hear me?!

503
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,500
As you wish.

504
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,000
I shall leave you for now,

505
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,125
but you are
still the chosen one.

506
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,291
And, when the time comes

507
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,208
for the ultimate battle,

508
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,458
I will return

509
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,583
and send for you.

510
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,750
That

511
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,500
you cannot escape.

512
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,458
It is your destiny.

513
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,583
For so long now,

514
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,000
I've tried to be
there for everyone.

515
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,083
Tried to live up
to the responsibility

516
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,083
that comes
with this great power.

517
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,750
But when push came to shove,

518
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,375
I failed the people
who needed me most.

519
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,708
The woman I love is gone.

520
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,416
Gone. Forever.

521
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,375
Where am I? Peter?!

522
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,958
Somebody, please!

523
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,375
Help me!

524
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,000
Help meeee!

525
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:49,166
