00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:23,875
I'm listening.

165
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,333
There will be
nothing else to hear

166
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,833
until you guarantee me
your cooperation.

167
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,833
I guarantee you nothing.

168
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,625
Your choice, Octavius.

169
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:36,875
Either fall in line,
or fall 70 stories.

170
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,375
Aaah!

171
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,000
Kingpin, I'm sure
we can work together

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
to some mutually
beneficial conclusion!

173
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,875
I knew I could count on you.

174
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:51,458
Landon, say hello
to our newest ally.

175
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,458
Ah, Octavius, how timely.

176
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,458
We're ready to communicate
with The Chameleon again.

177
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,875
The Chameleon?
But isn't he in jail?

178
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:03,875
Exactly, and because he is
such a danger to the world,

179
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,458
he was incarcerated

180
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,875
in the highest security prison
ever built.

181
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,000
A prison whose very location

182
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,208
is a military top secret,
just as I expected.

183
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,875
Then how--
how can you find him?

184
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,000
Watch.

185
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,500
When I allowed the authorities
to apprehend The Chameleon,

186
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,333
Landon here had already

187
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:30,000
infused him
with a techno-organic virus.

188
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,250
[Landon] It altered
his physiological makeup.

189
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,750
He is now part machine.

190
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,708
This allows The Chameleon

191
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,250
to have his morphing ability,
without the cumbersome apparatus

192
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,875
of his image-inducing belt.

193
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,000
It has one other benefit.

194
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,625
He is now biologically emitting
a powerful homing signal.

195
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,708
Imagine our surprise
when we first learned

196
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,000
that he was somewhere
in the air.

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,291
The air?

198
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,375
We're within range.

199
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,416
I'm activating
the neuro-optic imager.

200
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,458
Everything The Chameleon sees,

201
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,958
is now
instantly broadcast to me.

202
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,416
Incredible.

203
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,750
Chameleon,
show us your cell mate

204
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,708
in that highly guarded
security facility.

205
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,958
[Doctor Octopus] That man!
It's John Hardesky.

206
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,125
-The Cat!
-Exactly.

207
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,166
And if what The Chameleon
tells us is true,

208
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:24,291
Hardesky holds a secret
that is worth a king's ransom.

209
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:28,291
All we have to do is get it.

210
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,833
But where is
this prison in the sky?

211
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,708
That is my next surprise.

212
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,375
Have you ever heard
of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,875
[beeping]

214
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,000
Could this Cat
really be Felicia's father?

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And if so, what became of him?

216
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I can't find any record of
what prison they sent him to.

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,875
Another odd thing,
in most of the pictures,

218
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,708
there's the same guy
always near Hardesky.

219
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:01,250
Maybe if I enlarge
the shot I can I.D. him.

220
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,333
I know that face.

221
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,750
Yeah, it's Nick Fury,
the head of S.H.I.E.L.D.

222
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,000
What did he have
to do with all this?

223
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,125
If I knew that, I might
be able to help Felicia.

224
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,291
Wait, there may be a way.

225
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,250
[Nick] Welcome
to Supreme Headquarters

226
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,583
International Espionage
Law Enforcement Division.

227
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,125
We call it S.H.I.E.L.D.

228
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,750
Now, I need for you
to wear this.

229
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,958
If you see anything suspicious,
tap on this pin,

230
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,291
and undercover S.H.I.E.L.D.
agents will respond pronto.

231
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,291
I gotta to get that badge.

232
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,583
I'm in luck.
Jameson's on his way out.

233
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,833
So where does
a guy like Jonah keep

234
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:55,625
a little com badge
for a top secret agency.

235
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,750
He wouldn't frame it would he?

236
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,875
Wait a minute.

237
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,583
-[door opens]
-Uh-oh.

238
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,458
[Spider-Man]
If you want good reception,

239
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,000
head for the top
of the world,

240
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,708
or at least
the top of the city.

241
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,000
After all this,
it better still work.

242
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,125
[beeping]

243
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,250
Maybe they'll send one
of those flying limo's for me.

244
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,083
Yeah, now that's service.

245
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,083
[S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent] Spider-Man,
please surrender peacefully.

246
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,083
Surrender? Hey, I just want
to talk to Nick Fury.

247
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,625
Agent 13 is now
approaching you with restraints.

248
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,750
[Spider-Man]
This isn't going to work.

249
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,875
[groaning]

250
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,458
Look, don't you guys understand?

251
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,833
Immobilizer, five o'clock!

252
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,125
Fire!

253
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,000
[groaning]

254
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,708
I can't move!

255
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,583
Cables! Fire!

256
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,375
Now I know what it feels
like to be vacuumed packed.

257
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,083
At least I've gotten them

258
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,375
to take me
to their castle in the sky.

259
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,000
Here he is, Colonel Fury.

260
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,583
Well, long time, no see,
Spider-Man.

261
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,166
I thought you had
your fill of us

262
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,291
when we tackled The Chameleon
back at the U.N.

263
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,333
I need information
about a criminal named The Cat.

264
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,416
The Cat? This isn't
like ordering a pizza.

265
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,458
S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't deliver
classified information

266
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:29,208
within 15 minutes or
the first state secret is free.

267
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,875
I regret that I can't
help you at all.

268
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,708
-But--
-Take him back and drop him off.

269
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,291
Gently this time.

270
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,833
Come with me, Spider-Man.

271
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,250
Sorry, I'm not ready
to leave just yet.

272
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,416
Don't force me
to get tough again.

273
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,458
Oh!

274
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,708
Oh!

275
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,583
Well, that will cut down
on my webbing expenses.

276
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,708
I just have to download
a little info,

277
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,458
then I'll be out of your hair.

278
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,875
Let's see what S.H.I.E.L.D.
has on The Cat.

279

Now comes the tricky part.

283
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,583
Getting out
of this flying fortress.

284
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,958
[explosion]

285
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,458
Uh-oh, now what?

286
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,083
I don't know who's behind this,

287
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,458
but it looks
like the agency just got caught

288
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,500
with their S.H.I.E.L.D. down.

289
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,875
I trust that you now appreciate,
the full genius of my plan.

290
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,833
This flying fortress is amazing!

291
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:45,583
My attacking stealth airship
could not of gotten close enough

292
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,250
without my cloaking technology.

293
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,000
But can you defeat
an enemy this well armed?

294
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,250
I don't have to defeat
S.H.I.E.L.D.

295
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,708
Just distract them.

296
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,333
Someone open this door! Now!

297
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,875
Colonel, how'd you get in there?

298
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,875
I was locked in there
by an escaping prisoner!

299
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,000
Find him!

300
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,333
Well done, Chameleon.

301
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:20,208
Now bring Hardesky
to the rendezvous site.

302
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,500
Where are you taking me?

303

All you need to know is

304
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,333
someone went through a lot
of trouble to spring you,

305

and it's not because
of your charm.

00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:53,500
1943." John Hardesky would
have only been a boy of 13.

323
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,750
Seems that his file
begins here,

324
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,458
with him creeping
into a top secret facility,

325
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,000
thinking that he'd been
hired by the government

326
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,083
to spy on Nazis.

327
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:06,458
Trained as an acrobat, the boy
possessed tremendous agility.

328
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,083
[scientist]
Gentlemen, it is time to unveil

329
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,958
the volunteer
for this top secret experiment--

330
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,875
Private Steve Rogers.

331
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:16,000
Young man, the risk you take
today could very well tip

332
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,291
the scales
of the war in our favor.

333
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,708
I pray it does, sir.

334
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,250
[power starts]

335
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,708
[Peter] But Hardesky
had one other important skill--

336
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,875
a photographic memory.

337
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,875
And with it,
he undertook the mission

338
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,458
of memorizing
a top secret formula.

339
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,833
[scientist]
It won't be long now.

340
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,458
This is only the beginning.

341
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,083
[Peter] That secret formula
held the key

342
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,708
to producing
an amazing transformation

343
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,708
in a normal human being.

344
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,125
Rogers is merely the first

345
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,375
of a new breed
of super soldiers,

346
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:06,000
who will free the world from
the tyranny of the Axis powers.

347
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Gentlemen,
meet the new champion

348
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,458
of the Allied forces,
Captain America.

349
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,458
[Peter]
Young Hardesky realized

350
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:18,000
that what he had seen being
made that night was history.

351
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,208
It was also tragedy.

352
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,958
In the name of the Fatherland,

353
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,458
I will destroy
this American war machine!

354
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,458
[zapping]

355
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,625
Friend!
It's going to explode!

356
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,083
[men shouting]

357
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,708
[Peter] Hardesky escaped
from the exploding complex,

358
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,333
but there
were new realizations

359
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,375
that clouded the success
of his mission.

360
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,750
[Hardesky]
I'm here for deliveries.

361
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,958
[bartender] Storeroom.

362
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,166
Ah, Cat, you made it back.

363
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:59,125
Were you able to retrieve
the information?

364
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,833
I would expect nothing less from
the son of The Great Hardesky,

365
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,166
the finest escape artist
of our time.

366
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,833
I memorized the formula,

367
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,833
but there's something
I don't understand.

368
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:14,458
Why would Axis spies name
their agent Captain America?

369
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,833
[laughing]

370
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,458
They weren't Nazis, were they?

371
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,125
You're the Nazis!

372
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,375
You're trying to get me
to betray my country!

373
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,833
I'll never tell anyone
the formula! Never!

374
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,750
After him, you fools!
Don't let him escape!

375
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,708
-Unh!
-Oof!

376
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,416
[Peter] John Hardesky
grew up to be The Cat.

377
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,708
S.H.I.E.L.D.
took him into custody

378
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,291
to prevent
the super soldier formula

379
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,958
from falling
into the wrong hands.

380
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,583
Felicia's mom must
have changed their name.

381
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,458
But what do I tell Felicia?

382
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,000
"Hey, I've got some good news
and some bad news?

383
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,333
The good news is,
your father's still alive.

384
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,958
The bad is they've locked him
up and thrown away the key

385
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,458
because he knows too much."

386
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,291
-Nervous, Miss Hardy?
-[gasp]

387
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,750
You!

388
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,750
Aah!

389
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,291
What are you doing here?

390
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,625
Just picking up
a special package.

391
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,458
[Felicia] Noooo!

392
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,958
Felicia's been
through so much lately.

393
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,625
I'm not for sure how
she's going to take this.

394
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,583
Felicia!

395
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:28,083
Whatever happened here,
I'm too late! Again!

396
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:33,583
I vowed never to reveal
that formula to anyone.

397
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,000
I may of been a crook,

398
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,708
but I am not a traitor
to my country.

399
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,875
I don't care what you do to me.

400
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,375
Mr. Hardesky, I have

401
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,583
much more persuasive methods
at my disposal.

402
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,416
[Felicia]
Put me down, you big--

403
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,083
[Kingpin]
Impeccable timing.

404
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:51,833
Wilson Fisk?!
What is the meaning of this?!

405
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,750
One might say I have gone

406
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,250
into the business
of family reunions.

407
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,708
How long you enjoy
each other's company

408
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:05,625
depends on how well
you cooperate with me.

409
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:11,833
Felicia Hardy, allow me
to introduce you to your father.
