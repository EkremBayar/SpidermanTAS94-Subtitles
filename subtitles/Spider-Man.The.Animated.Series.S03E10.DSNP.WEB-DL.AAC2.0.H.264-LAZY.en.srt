[thunder]

165
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,333
Mordo, I need you.

166
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,833
Mordo!

167
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,833
Yes, Master Dormammu.

168
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,166
I am yours to command.

169
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:09,875
The symbiote is finally back
on Earth, just as I planned.

170
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:15,583
Now go
to Ravencroft Sanitarium
and contact Eddie Brock.

171
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:20,291
It is time for him to play
his part in our affair.

172
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,500
[thunder]

173
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,583
[Brock]
You can't be real!

174
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,583
I want to be well.

175
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,875
Leave me alone!

176
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,500
I am not a delusion, my boy.

177
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,208
I've merely come
to you in my astral form.

178
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,291
I want to restore to you

179
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,583
that which is rightfully
yours, the symbiote.

180
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,375
How do you know about that?

181
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,958
My master, Dormammu,
knows everything.

182
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,208
You need only swear
to serve him,

183
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,583
and the symbiote will
be yours once more.

184
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,708
He can make you whole again.

185
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:55,875
Hey, you in there, whoever
you are, forget Brock.

186
00:08:55,875 --> 00:09:00,208
If this Dormammu guy
can get me out of here,

187
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,333
I'll do whatever he wants.

188
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,333
Whatever.

189
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,833
Buzz off, laughing boy.

190
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,333
Why are you hesitating, Eddie?

191
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,958
Don't you miss the symbiote?

192
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,208
And don't you want
to get out of here

193
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,875
and destroy Spider-Man?

194
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:14,958
Okay, okay.

195
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,250
You got a deal.

196
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,083
Just tell me what I have to do.

197
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,625
My master, it is done.

198
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:29,875
Excellent.

199
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,958
Now, we are poised to obtain

200
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:37,750
the last piece of the puzzle
at Stark Enterprises.

201
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,833
[Debra] Peter, do you really
think that they can make

202
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,875
an interdimensional probe?

203
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,875
Well, if anyone can, Debra,
it's Stark Enterprises.

204
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,458
This could be one of
the most important

205
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,333
scientific breakthroughs
in history.

206
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,708
Well, it could create a gateway

207
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:55,458
to whole new worlds,
other dimensions.

208
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah, and it could also
accidentally let something

209
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,291
get through to us
that shouldn't.

210
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,375
-[Dr. Connors] Debra! Peter!
-[Debra] Dr. Connors.

211
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,583
Come on, the demonstration's
about to start.

212
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,875
Debra Whitman, Peter Parker,
this is Jim Rhodes,

213
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,833
head of security
for Stark Enterprises.

214
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,708
Miss Whitman, Mr. Parker.

215
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,708
Now, there's
a real cheerful guy.

216
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,291
I don't think cheer is part
of his job description.

217
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,208
[Dr. Connors] There's
the interdimensional probe.

218
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,708
Just think, a machine
that might allow us

219
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:28,333
to transcend the limitations
of space, perhaps even time.

220
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,083
If it works,
Tony Stark's a genius.

221
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,166
That's Ardon Broom.

222
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,375
His electronics company
is a supplier
to Stark Enterprises.

223
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,875
[thinking]
If that's not Baron Mordo,

224
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,583
then I don't stick to walls.

225
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,333
He must be here
to use this technology

226
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:45,000
to transport Dormammu
to our dimension.

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
[Stark] Good day, and welcome,
scientists and scholars.

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,833
Today, we are here to begin
a new era in technology.

229
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,625
Our plan is to actually
teleport solid matter

230
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,291
instantaneously from New York,
where all of you are,

231
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,833
to our labs here
in Los Angeles.

232
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,333
We're gonna be using
an interdimensional gateway

233
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,000
built expressly
for that purpose.

234
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,166
Incredible.

235
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,583
[guard]
Brock, you've got a visitor.

236
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,000
-A visitor?
-[woman] Eddie Brock?

237
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah.

238
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,166
Do I know you?

239
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,416
Don't you recognize us?

240
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,625
Eddie?

241
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,958
How about now?!

242
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,208

Together again!

246
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,708
We knew it wasn't a delusion.

00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:40,250
-[gasps]
-Do you believe us now, Doctor?

248
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,208
Eddie, is that you?

249
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,875
There's no more Eddie,
and no more symbiote.

250
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,500
Only Venom!

251
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,750
Eddie?
Please, don't go!

252
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,875
[Cletus]
No, give it to me!

253
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,000
I want the power.

254
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,583
I deserve the power.

255
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,875
[Venom growls]

256
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:06,291
The symbiote could have
bonded with anyone,

257
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:10,125
but only the rage and
frustration of Eddie Brock

258
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,416
could have created Venom.

259
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,500
You are truly unique.

260
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,833
That is why I need you.

261
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,750
How did you make us one again?

262
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,375
At a place
called Stark Enterprises,

263
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,708
my assistant, Baron Mordo,

264
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,875
secretly gained access
to the ground-control system

265
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:33,083
for the space probe to which
the symbiote was attached.

266
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,833
[computer beeping]

267
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:38,458
I ordered Mordo to guide
the probe back to Earth.

268
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:45,125
From there,
it was a simple matter
of locating the symbiote

269
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,958
and hypnotizing
its hosts into submission.

270
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,958
What do you want
from us in return?

271
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,000
You must get something for me,

272
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,250
something very important.

273
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,250

Come on,
it's not safe for us here!

289

We want the probe!

get near the probe!

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The most incredible thing
about this creature

326
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,750
is that it bears a striking
resemblance to Spider-Man.

327
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,208
Spider-Man?
I'm going down there myself.

328
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,000
The creature seems to have
all of Spider-Man's powers,

329
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,166
but it calls itself Venom.

330
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,833

-[lasers zap]
-Aaah!

333
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,875
[Dormammu] Mordo!

334
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,416
My master.

335
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,083
Venom is facing
formidable foes.

336
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,083
There is a chance that
the probe will be lost to us.

337
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,958
[Dormammu] Mordo,
I leave nothing to chance.

338
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,875
The probe will be secured,

339
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:04,458
if not by Venom alone,
then with someone else.

340
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,500
Someone else?

341
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,875
When I ordered you to retrieve
the symbiote from space,

342
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,458
I did so not only
because of its strength,

343
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:18,250
but also because it
was about to reproduce.

344
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,583
The symbiote can do that?

345
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,875
It can, and it has.

346
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,000
There is now another.

347
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,333
But to be effective,

348
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:33,125
won't the second symbiote
need as its host

349
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,083
someone as fanatical as Brock?

350
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,708
[Dormammu] Yes.

351
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,458

[Mordo]
It is my master, Dormammu,

359
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,750
who confers this gift
upon you, Kasady.

360
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,875
-Gift?
-Remember?

361
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:19,625
You wanted the same power
that I offered Eddie Brock.

362
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,291
This is it?

363
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,166
But to enjoy it,

364
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:28,250
you must first swear
to serve Dormammu forever.

365
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,208
No problem, man.
He sounds like my kind of guy.

366
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,625
Let me have the power.

367
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,583
What do I do?

368
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:38,625
This is a symbiote,
a living organism.

369
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,250
It must bond with you.

370
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,583
And then I get
to be like Brock?

371
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,416
Similar, but different,

372
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,416
as different
as you are from Brock.

373
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:52,250
Once you bond, it will reflect
your hatred for humanity,

374
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,833
your lust for destruction.

-I'll take it!
-It must take you.

Come on.

What are you waiting for?

I am yours, man.
