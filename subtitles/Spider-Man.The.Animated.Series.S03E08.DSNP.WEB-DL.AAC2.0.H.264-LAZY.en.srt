00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,000
[Spencer] It'll be just your
size when it's finished.

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,875
Is that why
you're working for Osborn?

165
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,708
Alistair, I'd do
anything to help you.

166
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,000
Remember our deal?

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,583
No spider splat,
no hover chair.

168
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,583
All right.

169
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,125
My father.

00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,125

173
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,958
Hey, freak,
get back in your cage!

174
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,000
Aaah!

175
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,708
Stay back! He's too strong!

176
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,625
[Landon] Stop!
I command you to stop!

177
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,708
The humanoid equivalent
of a robot, eh?

178
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,625
[May] You must be so
happy for Mary Jane, Anna.

179
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,500
Oh, I am.

180
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,833
Harry is such
a nice, responsible boy.

181
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,208
Still, it's sad.

182
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,000
What is?

183
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,375
I had always hoped Mary Jane
would settle on Peter.

184
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,416
Pardon my frankness, May,

185
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,291
but Peter never
was there for her.

186
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,583
He's always running around--

187
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,583
Aunt May, I'm late.

188
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,166
I've gotta get dressed

189
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,500
for that press conference
at Oscorp Towers.

190
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Oh.

191
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,708
Hello, Mrs. Watson.

192
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,958
Oh, hello, Peter.

193
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,708
Did you say you were
going to Oscorp Towers?

194
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,708
Well, Mary Jane's going
to be there with Harry.

195
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,958
Did you know they've
announced their engagement?

196
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,750
Uh, yeah.

197
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,625
I saw the picture in the paper.

201
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,583
Landon, what is going on?

202
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,458
Alistair is apparently
accessing his memories

203
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,958
in order to reprogram himself.

204
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,458
Fascinating.

205
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,583
That is not
the word I would use.

206
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,708
[computer] Current
location of Norman Osborn,

Probability, 95.37%

209
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,625
This is a disaster.

210
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,000
Osborn and I have
resolved our differences,

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,333
and his resources
are important to me.

212
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,250
Reprogram Smythe immediately!

213
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,583
[static]

214
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,000
I can't!

215
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,083
He's just terminated
our connection!

216
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,208
[Jonah]
You sure know how to keep

217
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,583
the Oscorp stockholders
happy, Norman.

218
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,875
According to your
press release,

219
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,333
this subway car
is just the first

220
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,000
of dozens
of defense conversion projects.

221
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,750
It's a big step, Jonah.

222
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,750
That's why I wanted
a major press event

223
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,958
to announce the contracts.

224
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,500
Take lots of pictures, Parker.

225
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,583
This could be
a multi-billion dollar deal.

226
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,583
[Peter] Yes, Mr. Jameson.

227
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,166
-Hello, tiger.
-Mary Jane.

228
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,000
I guess you heard
the big news already huh?

229
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,208
Uh, yeah.

230
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,000
I was a little surprised.

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I wanted to tell you myself,
but Harry let the word out.

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,208
Oh, sometimes
he's so impetuous,

233
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,833
like a kid
on Christmas morning.

234
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,583
I'm very happy for you.

235
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,000
Actually, that's a lie.

236
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,875
What I wanna ask is--

237
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:11,875
Why Harry?

238
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:18,875
Listen, Peter, all my life,
men have let me down.

239
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,500
Harry's different though.

240
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,166
He gives me a lot of attention.

241
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,875
He seems like he'll
always be there for me.

242
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,875
But do you love him?

243
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:31,291
Excuse me, Peter, I promised
Mrs. Peabody Oakhurst Smith

244
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,291
that I'd discuss, uh, wedding
gown designers with her.

245
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,125
She'll be crushed if I don't.

246
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,125

No. I didn't think so.

I have an important
announcement to make.

00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,083
But first, I'd like
to congratulate my son Harry

00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:52,583
and my future daughter-in-law
Mary Jane Watson.

As you saw in today's paper,

253
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,291
they've just announced
their engagement.

[Harry] What does
that-- that thing want?!

[groans]

271
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,625
Isn't there any way
to stop him?

00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,708
I've already sent

we have some unexpected guests.

00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,708
Make sure they do not
see where they are going.

Take Smythe to the lab.

283

Lock them up.

284
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,458
Please accept
my humble apologies

285
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,416
for the inconvenience, Osborn.

286
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,875
Inconvenience?

287
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,500
There's an understatement.

288
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,708
Fisk, what in the world
did you do to Smythe?

289
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,500
A misstep in the furtherance
of science.

290
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,166
Had I known he held you
responsible

291
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,625
for his father's
disappearance, I--

292
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,208
Me?! It was your men
who caused the explosion

293
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,958
at his father's lab!

294
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,583
Smythe should be going
after your throat, not mine!

295
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,875
It's your fault
he lost his father!

296
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:14,291
Ah, but Spencer Smythe
is not lost.

297
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,291
What?!

298
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:20,416
Somehow, he survived
the explosion of your factory.

299
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,375
[explosion]

300
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,416
I found him amid the wreckage.

301
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,416
I knew he would be
unwilling to work for me.

302
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:32,708
But all the same, a genius
is a terrible thing to waste.

303
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:36,875
So I put him
into cryogenic suspension.

304
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,708
And when I told Alistair
that Spider-Man
was responsible

305
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,458
for his father's disappearance,

306
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,375
I gained a younger genius
and one willing to share

307
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,000
a valuable robotic
technology for nothing

308
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
but the promise of revenge.

309
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,291
That's unbelievable.

310
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,291
-Where is Spencer Smythe now?
-[click]

311

In the same cryogenic unit
that he has always occupied.

00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,458
In this building.
Five floors down.

check out the unauthorized

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
At last, I have him!

-[grunting]
-Hey!

318
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,875
Landon, reactivate Alistair

319
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,750
and give him the new
hover-chair you created.

320
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,416
But I haven't finished
reprogramming!

321
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,458
Do it now!

got a good deal
