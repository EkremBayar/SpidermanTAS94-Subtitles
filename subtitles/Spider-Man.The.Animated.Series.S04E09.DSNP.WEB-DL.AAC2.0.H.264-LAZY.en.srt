00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,250
Peter, help me!

167
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,958
You'll never know how strange
it is to be gone for so long,

168
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,708
and then to return
with no memory

169
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,375
of where you've been.

170
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,708
All I have are strange dreams.

171
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,333
Weird images
that flash in my head.

172
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,000
Sometimes I think
if I don't do something,

173
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,833
I'm gonna go crazy.

174
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,250
Fine, I just hope
this action adventure movie

175
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,000
doesn't suddenly
become a disaster film.

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,166
[man]
Five minutes, Miss Watson.

177
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,208
I'll be right out.

178
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,291
[ghostly man's voice]
Mary Jane!

179
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,625
Mary Jane!

180
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,500
Who-- Who's there?

181
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,583
Mary Jane!

182
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,625
-No, what's wrong with me?
-[loud bang]

183

Am I going crazy?

186
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,375
Please, stay where you are.

187
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,416
Wait a minute, I know you.

188
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,250
Yes, Mary Jane.

189
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,000
I've come back to make up
for having left you

190
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,208
so many years ago.

191
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,291
And-and-and this house,
it's never clean!

192

Lousy kids leave
everything in a mess!

193

Forget it, I'm outta here!

194
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,208
[gasps] Daddy?

195
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,708
[voice reverberating]
Yes, my dear.

196
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,375
Come with me, don't be afraid.

197
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,583
Where's the Watson girl?
I need her now!

198
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,291
I gave her the five-minute
warning ages ago, JS.

199
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,708
She probably
just has the jitters.

200
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,458
I'll go get her.

201
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,208
Why would she lock her door?

She's disappeared.

Not again!

built these tunnels.

But why?

[Mary Jane] Father?

My father, he came back!

He was going to explain
what happened to me!

Oh, Spider-Man.

219
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,583
Am I going mad?

220
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,000
I hope not, Miss Watson.

221
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Maybe you're just tired.

Uh-oh.

223
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,333
I'll just bet I know who was
really behind that apparition.

224
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,416
[Spider-Man]
Always got a trick or two
up your sleeve, huh, Beck?

225
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,833
Who's there?

226
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,458
Spider-Man,
lovely of you to drop by.

227
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,000
Get over it, Beck.

228
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,500
I saw some
pretty bizarre things today,

229
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,875
so I came to check and see

230
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,875
if the man I put
behind bars was real.

231
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,708
Or just another robot.

232
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,750
Ow! It's me all right,
in the flesh.

-It isyou.
-Well, duh.

234
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,708
Then who created
the illusions I saw

235
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,125
in the catacombs
under Wonder Studios?

236
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,500
Catacombs, no!

237
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,125
Spider-Man,
stay away from there.

238
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,958
If you go back, you'll
face your worst nightmare.

239
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,333
What are you talking about?

240
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,500
Give me some answers!

241
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,125
Oh, forget it.

242
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,250
This was a waste of my time.

243
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,166
Well, I did slip
a spider-tracer on you, Beck.

244
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,708
Just in case.

245
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:23,875
And you thought
I was just trying

246
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,458
to pull your face off.

247
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,083
Nice try, wall weasel.

248
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,833
But you can't trick a trickster.

249
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,458
You have, however,
provided me

250
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,833
with the one thing
I needed most.

panic-stricken, but not you.

Where are you taking me?

00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,958
[Mary Jane's father]
Just a bit further.

Then all your questions
will be answered.

How do you manage to be in
two places at once, Mysterio?

00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,458
Bravo, Spider-Man.

282

This time, I think you'll find
there's a bit more to Mysterio

283
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,208
than smoke and mirrors.

one Mysterio wasn't enough.

289
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,625
Tough choice,
but I guess I'll go with the one

290
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,833
who prevented
my untimely demise.

Come this way!

Why should I trust you?

296
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,458
Because the automatons
that you've already faced

297
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,875
were nothing compared
to what's in store for you!

298
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,708
I acquired
this deadly technology

299

from Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin.

300
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,583
[Kingpin] Alistair Smythe
was brilliant with robotics,

301
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,333
but as he's no longer with me,

302
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,583
his technology is mine to sell.

303
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,166
[Mysterio]
Very impressive, Mr. Fisk.

304
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:25,708
It's exactly
the technology I need.

305
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,708
The simulacra
specifications are yours,

306

if you can meet my price.

307
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,000
And not just money.

308
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,958
You must use this technology
to destroy Spider-Man.

309
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,375
No, I have other concerns
besides Spider-Man now!

310
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,458
Then I suggest you drop them

311
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,875
and attend
to that annoying arachnid,

312
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,875
or forget about this technology.

I had prepared
for your destruction,

314
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,625
when I was arrested trying
to steal the treasure

315
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,458
to pay off Kingpin.

But my surprise for you
is still in operation.

for your ultimate destruction.

Only if you help me.

I couldn't let anyone

He had gotten out of prison

and come back
for equipment he kept here.

He became Mysterio again,
so he could steal the money

and buy robotic machinery
needed to save my life.

Quentin made me self-sufficient

by directly hooking my mind
to these new machines
