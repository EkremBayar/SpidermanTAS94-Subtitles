[Taina] Why won't
anyone listen to me?!

163
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,625
Just because
I'm eight years old,

164
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,000
doesn't mean I'm lying!

[brakes screech]

166
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,375
Of course, it don't, girl.

167
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,958
All de same,
that's a pretty wild story.

168
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,958
Spider-Man's really in trouble!

169
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,958
He'd help you
if you were in trouble.

170
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,458
Hold it right there, girlie.

171

I know what kind of man he is.

[dramatic music]

173
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,250
He once rescued me
from a mugger.

174
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,000
I'd hate to think what would
have happened to the Mouse

175
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,583
if Spider-Man hadn't
been there for me.

176
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,000
But Dr. Octopus
wiped out his memory,

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,458
so Spider-Man's not here
anymore for anybody.

178
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,708
You have to help!
You owe him one!

179
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,458
Don't you be telling me
what I owe, girl.

180
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,833
[Taina]
If you don't believe me,

181
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,625
I'll just find
somebody who will.

182

Now, I didn't say nothing
about not believing ya.

Sit over there
and fasten your seat belt.

[tires screech]

185
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,000
[Taina] I know it's one
of these buildings.

186
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,833
That's them! That's them!

187
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,000
So it is.

188
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You were right.

189
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:36,625
Well, partner, this casing
for the argon matrix laser

190
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,208
requires a rare metal alloy,

191
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:43,416
one that we must liberate
from the Wellington Foundry.

192
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,500
The security staff
here is a virtual army,

193
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,833
but it should prove no match

194
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,291
for the combined might of
Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man.

195
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,583
Follow my instructions
to the letter.

196
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,625
Your timing must be precise.

197
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,958
[Spider-Man] Sure thing, Ock,
old buddy.

198

[Taina]
There's Spider-Man!

199
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,833
This don't look good, girl.

200
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,208
Taina, wait!

00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,875

Whatever you are, freeze!

[Spider-Man]
Ock's scheme is brilliant.

207
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,500
While he distracts them,

208
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,375
I'm free to sneak in unnoticed.

209
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,291
All I have to do is
avoid the alarms.

you're going, girl?

Ock said to stay
above the floor

to avoid their sensor beams.

216

Now, where would they keep
their precious alloys?

Aha!

This is the alloy,
but how did I know that?

220
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,083
And why do I feel so guilty?

221
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,250
-Spider-Man, don't!
-A little girl.

could turn me

Hello, boys.

why I called this meeting.

Yes, but it's not his fault!

[Mousie] This is
a much bigger problem

-We saw the whole thing.
-Oh, really?

248
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,416
Do you expect
a serious news organization

249
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:27,500
to rely on a little girl
and a cabbie
as reliable sources?

It's true, mon.

It was the Spider-Man
and de Octopus.

De Octopus got Spider-Man
working for him.

Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus?

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,625
Maybe you should sit down
and tell me everything.

255
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,291
Spider-Man is innocent.

256
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,333
He doesn't remember who he is.

Very reliable sources

forces with Doctor Octopus

260
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,166
to form a crime duo

261
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,125

be invincible.

to get pictures of Spider-Man.

Did you find the little girl?

[Spider-Man]
No, she got away.

324

Quickly, we must

How about a little more air?

That little girl,
who is she anyway?

331
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,625
You must remember Taina.

She thinks the world of you.

You cannot let her down.

I make web fluid that load
into these web-shooters.

All I cared about back then was
taking care of number one-- me.

-She is of no value.

You can't do this!

All these images.

It feels like I want
to remember them,

but then my head
starts throbbing.
