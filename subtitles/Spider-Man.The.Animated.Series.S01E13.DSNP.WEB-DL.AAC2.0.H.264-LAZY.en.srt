Espionage
Law-Enforcement Division.

We call it S.H.I.E.L.D.

135

Never heard of it!

136
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,250
Even the FBI and CIA
are kept in the dark about us.

137
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,583
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s job
is to secretly try to

138
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:24,708
keep the world in one piece,
no matter what it takes.

139
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:30,458
This is the Chameleon,
a deadly stop-at-nothing
hit man.

140
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,166
He can transform himself
into a carbon-copy

141
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,583
of any person who's image
he can grab with this.

142
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:40,250
I first heard of him
in Istanbul
when he blew up an embassy.

143
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,375
In Rome, he attacked
a military post,

144
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,375
and then gave us
the slip by taking

145
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,750
on the appearance
of a clergyman.

146
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,416
Last I ran into him
was in Sarajevo,

147
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,708
he got away as nurse.

148
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,458
No way he's gonna beat me
again!

149
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,000
So? What's this
got to do with me?

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,625
The Chameleon's been hired

151
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,500
by terrorists to total
the peace treaty.

152
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,000
And that could mean war.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,625
[Peter thinking] So that's it!

154
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,000
[Fury] This morning he arrived
in New York City.

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,625
New York? My party!

156
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,583
And that's where we'll
find the Chameleon!

157
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,583
In a disguise
that's undetectable!

158
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:25,125
But I'm having police,
security, and FBI there!

159
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,875
The place'll be sealed
up tighter than--

160
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,500
[Fury] They won't
even notice him.

161
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,625
[John] Then why don't
we just cancel the party?

162
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:34,500
No can do, gotta act
like everything's normal.

163
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,875
If we shut down every time
someone threatens us,

164
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,458
the whole world would stop.

165
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,208
Now, I need you to wear this.

166
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,625
Nobody knows your employees
better than you do.

167
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,583
That's why you're
important to me.

168
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:48,083
If you see anything
suspicious, tap on this pin,

169
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,875
and undercover S.H.I.E.L.D.
agents will respond pronto.

The Bugle building is
crawling with them.

171
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,625
But what do I--

172
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,875
Just keep your eyes open.

173
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,375
I'm sending you back now.

174

What was that all about?

177
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,208
National security, Parker,
can't discuss it.

[Glory] Mr. Jameson!

You're back early, is your
tuxedo fitting all done?

183
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,125
Yeah, all done.

184
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,875
I need the security
plans for tonight!

185
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,500
I left a copy in your briefcase
a half hour ago.

186
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,833
I need them in my hands
right now!

187
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,708
Do you have a problem
with that?

188
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,500
No, sir, I'll get them. Again.

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,625
Oh, hi there, Jonah.

190
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,208
Robby, I must talk to you
in private. Immediately!

[Peter thinking]
Something's not right.

-Here.
-What's this?

[Glory] The security
plans for tonight.

194
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,458
You gave me a copy
before I left.

195
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,708
I know, that's what I told you!

196
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,708
Are you trying to
drive me crazy?

197
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,958
What's wrong with her?

198
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,583
Jonah! I've gotta make
a quick phone call.

199
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,583
I'll be right back.

200
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,291
Uh, Mr. Jameson,
I've gotta run.

201
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,708
Hold it, Parker.

202
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,958
This little event today,
I don't want you to--

203
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,000
Hey! Where'd those
security plans go?

204
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,250
Well, they were right here.

205
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,458
Maybe Robby took them?

206
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,083
Well, why on Earth would he--

[Spider-Man thinking]
No spider sense, no Chameleon!

You've got it wrong!
Let him go!

What's he doing here?

[Fury, on radio]
Agent 1, get him!

[Agent 1] No imaging device!

He's not the one! Fan out!

I've got him!

He's in the form of Ms. Grant!

All agents, floor seven!

[Spider-Man] Gotcha!

224
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,416
I don't usually pick
up strange women.

225
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,875
Funny, but not too smart.

[Mary Jane moans]

I'll take that as a yes!

Peter, why'd you do that?

241
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,583
I had to.

242
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,000
What made you think
I'd let you?

243
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,875
I took a gamble
that Peter Parker

244
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,166
was the luckiest man on Earth.

gains the advantage!

Wherefore was I to
this keen mockery born?

00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,208
When at your hands did
I deserve such scorn,

that you must flout
my insufficiency?

Where in blazes are you,
Parker?

Good troth, you do me
wrong, good sooth, you do,

in such disdainful
manner me to woo.

But fare you well.

confess, I thought

to get the VIPs out.

here long enough.

Maybe I'd better keep
an eye on things.

Good job, agent.

it's the early bird

that catches the Chameleon.
Follow me.

Whaddaya know,
Fury's here in the flesh!

00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,583
I guess he wanted to
personally get them to a safe--

305
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:27,750

Stop! Look at Fury!

It's on the wrong eye!

00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,250
Send a crew
to check the wreckage!

321
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,708
We have to make sure
he didn't bail!

322
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:35,625
But how could the Chameleon
make such a stupid mistake?

323
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,458
That's simple, picklepuss.

324
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,250
He probably based his disguise

325
