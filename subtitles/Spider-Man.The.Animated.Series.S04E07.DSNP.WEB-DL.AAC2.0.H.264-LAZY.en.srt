her away and cure her.

No. I'm disappointed in Blade.

-I taught him better than this.
-[Morbius groaning]

Good, then we've done our job.

He wasn't responsible
for those last attacks,

217
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,958
and he just saved my life.

We have to help him.

Even if I thought it was
a good idea, what could we do?

[Spider-Man] Whistler,
what about that serum,

221
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,625
the one I once saw you give
to Blade to keep him human?

222
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,166
Couldn't we give him that?

223
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,625
He has to want to be human.

224
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,000
That's the only way
it will work.

225
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,625
Whistler, I believe
that now he does. Please.

226
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,750
This is against
my better judgment,

227
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,708
but let's get him
back to the theater.

228
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,125
The serum
appears to be working.

229
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,458
It seems odd to me
to be saving one of them.

230
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,250
-Will he be all right?
-I'm hopeful.

231
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,583
Saving him gets us nowhere.

The vampire locator is gone.

00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,000
How will we find
Miriam and Blade now?

234
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,375
[Morbius]
I can find them for you.

235

I can sense her presence.

236
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,291
That's how I found her
at the factory.

237
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,208
She is evil!

238
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,416
I have been in her mind.

It's almost dawn.

He can't do anything
until he's slept.

242
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,375
We ought to do the same.

243
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,208
Then what?

244
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,000
Blade will never let us
lay a finger on his mother.

245
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,208
[Spider-Man]
Then he is our enemy, too.

246
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,125
Blade is merely a lost child,

247

with the mother he never knew.

248

can understand that.

I never knew my parents,
either.

251

You all must help me
explain to him

that once a vampire,
always a vampire.

253
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,166
But I think
you can count on him

254
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,000
to do what's right in the end.

255
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I certainly hope you're right.

256
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,750
Our lives depend on it.

But my mother says
she wants to be human again.

What makes you think
you can trust her?

I had hoped you
would understand me.

You were the one

of feeling with my heart.

don't try to follow me.

00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,250
My true goal's
not to change myself,

326
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,458
but to create that family
of which I spoke,

327
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:17,125
a family of vampires!

328
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:21,416
And I will be their mother,
as well as yours.

329
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,375
Never! I trusted you!

330
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,083
Blade, you must forsake
your humanity.

331
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,416
But you are the one
who gave me my humanity!

you will become a vampire,

not the halfling
that you are now!

[Morbius] I sense
that Miriam is near.

337

We will save time
if we look separately.

Oh, nice suit, man.

Tonight the whole city
will be mine!

[Spider-Man] Incredible.
She's used Landon's knowledge

00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,083
to turn the Recombinator
into a vampire creator!

346
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,833
[Spider-Man] Come on!
We've got to stop Miriam!

Morbius, cover your face!

It does not matter.

I have no desire
to fight anymore,

You, here? But how?

Don't stop now!
You must go on!

I believe in you, Blade!

355

Your real mother is trapped
in that vampire's body,

356
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:10,625
and she needs
your love to rescue her.

357

You are right, Terri Lee.

Come, my vampire children.

She must realize

Oh, yeah.
I feel giddy with delight.

[Spider-Man] We've lost her.

-I'll go with you.
-No.

376

I've learned
that with this great power

comes a greater responsibility.

378
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,416
I have to use my power
where it's needed most,

Why can't I be with you?

384
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,375
Because you must stay here
and take care of this city.

-I need you!

You will,

Do this for me, please.

To join you, to give
