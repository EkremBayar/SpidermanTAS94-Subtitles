00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,958
Was that our J. Jonah Jameson?

163
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,333
Uh, what's up, Mr. Jameson?

164
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,166
You're friends
with Felicia Hardy.

165
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,083
Is she in some kind of trouble?

166
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,833
I'm not sure.
Why do you ask?

167
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,000
Not that it's
any of your business, Parker,

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,125
but Anastasia Hardy is
a guest at my penthouse.

169
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,458
Mrs. Hardy is staying with you?

170
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,000
She's afraid to go home,

171
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,708
but she won't tell me
what's wrong.

172
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,458
I tried all my other sources,

173
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,458
and now I'm reduced
to asking you.

174
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,125
I don't know
any more than you do.

175
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,458
Well, that's just dandy!

176
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,500
What are you wasting
my time for?!

177
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,583
Go back to your rooftops
and sewers!

178
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,750
[Peter] Right.

179
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,583
I can't believe it.

180
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,291
Jameson actually seems
to care about someone.

181
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,875
At least
that solves the mystery

182
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,208
of where Mrs. Hardy is.

183
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,583
-Nice view.
-[Anastasia gasps]

184
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,000
How dare you come here?

185
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,333
I'm concerned about Felicia.

186
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,458
Nobody's seen her, and--

187
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,291
She's not here!

188
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,458
And even if she were, my family
is none of your business.

189
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,583
Oh, no?
If Felicia's life's in danger,

190
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,250
shouldn't something be done?!

191
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,708
There's nothing anyone can do!

192
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,833
-Nothing!
-Mrs. Hardy, I'm begging you,

193
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,958
give me a chance to try!

194
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,958
I-- I can't!

195
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,708
Look, if you change your mind,
you can contact me with this.

196
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,458
Just press the center
to activate it.

197
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,208
I wish I knew what to do.

tell him I'm going home.

Time to go, kitten.

Sorry, I'm sure
the cells are bugged.

206

I'm just glad we're finally
getting out of here.

207
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,875
There is no "we."

208
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,708
Only you have the super strength
necessary to escape.

209
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,291
No, I won't go without you.

210
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,166
Please, no arguments.

211
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,416
I haven't given you much,
kitten,

212
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,458
but I can give you your freedom.

213

Hurry.

Where'd you get that?

217

Borrowed it from the lab.

[powder hissing]

219
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,125
Even at my best, kitten,
I never had what it'll take

220
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,166
to escape from this fortress.

221
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,875
I'm not sure I do, either.

You do. Trust me.

I will come back for you.

Where have you been?

00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:11,958
Are you all right?

229
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,458
Yes, and I've seen Daddy.

230
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,625
You've seen your father?

231
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,125
He told me everything.

232
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,375
I want to save him,
but I need help.

233
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,458
I suppose someone
has already volunteered.

[Felicia gasps]

235

I knew he wouldn't let me down.

Don't worry.

237

We'll take care of everything.

238
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,625
When I got
Mrs. Hardy's signal,

239
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,750
I assumed she was
in some sort of danger.

240

But why on earth
would she call me here?

Cool it, Spider.

Ooh, smart Spider.

If you work for Kingpin,
why don't you want to kill me?
