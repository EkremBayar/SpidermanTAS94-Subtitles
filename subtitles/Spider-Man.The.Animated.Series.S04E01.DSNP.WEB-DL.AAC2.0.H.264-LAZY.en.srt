Why haven't
you brought me anything?!

167
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,708
-Parker!
-Sorry I'm late, Mr. Jameson.

168
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,333
Sorry, nothing!

169
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,458
Why aren't you working
the Spider-Man angle?

170
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,500
It's clear he set Robbie up!

171
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,875
No it isn't, boss.

172
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,208
Did you ever think
that maybe Robbie

173
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,625
was working with Spider-Man

174
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,875
and Spidey betrayed him,

175
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,250
that Robbie could be guilty?

176
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,875
No, Leeds, not for a second.

177
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,000
Now either you find
me something I can use,

178
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,458
or you can find
yourself another job.

179
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,500
Got it?

180
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Right, boss.

181
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,000
Got it.

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,708
Ned Leeds is right
about one thing.

183
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,625
Spider-Man did betray Robbie.

184
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,416
After all the times
he stood up for me,

185
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,208
I helped put him behind bars.

186
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,166
I'm worried about you two.

187
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,875
What are you gonna do
while I'm gone?

188
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,583
We're fine, Robbie.

189
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,750
We're gonna hold it together
until you come home.

190
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,875
Why should we have
to hold it together?

191
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,708
It's Spider-Man's fault
you're in here!

192
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,458
Randy, Spider-Man was just doing
what he thought was right.

193
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,083
He's a good man at heart.

194
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,250
Oh, yeah, Dad?
If he's so good,

195
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,166
where is he to help you now?

196
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,458
Robbie says he woke up
with the blaster in his hand.

197
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:22,166
But if he's innocent,
why would he fire it?

198
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,291
Wait a minute.

[clicking]

200

The gun's firing,
but for no reason.

201
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,208
Robbie's been set up!

202
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:33,416
And whoever's behind it
is a master of deception.

203
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,500
Yes, all is going
according to plan.

204
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,208
Now, what remains
is for Robertson

205
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,958
to be sentenced to the proper
correctional facility.

206
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,875
And how on earth can
you control that?

207
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:49,500
You forget, I am a man
of unlimited resources.

208
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,208
I have my methods.

209
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,625
[officer] Alan, Richard,
Empire State Penitentiary.

210
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,375
Edelman, Matthew,
Empire State Penitentiary.

211
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,000
Robertson, Joseph,
New York State Pen.

212
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,458
-[power fails]
-Huh? What the heck is that?

213
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,000
You see?

214
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,500
All it takes is
a little ingenuity

215
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,500
and 25 million dollars' worth
of digital equipment.

216
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,333
[power resumes]

217
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,125
I don't know what that was,
but it's over now.

218
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,083
Robertson, Joseph,
Rooker's Island.

219
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,833
But wait-- wait a minute.

220
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,000
You just said he was going
to New York State Pen.

221
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,583
Couldn't have. It says
Rooker's Island right here.

222
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,458
Huh, I must've heard you wrong.

223
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay, next.

224
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,708
Good, now the rest
is up to Burch here.

225
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:32,875
Are you ready?

226
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,208
I'm ready.

227
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,833
Hi, Miss Grant.

228
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,458
I've gotta show Jameson
something right away.

229
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,500
Wait, Peter. Mr. Jameson's
in a really bad mood.

230
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,000
News of Robbie's
sentencing has just come

231
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,833
over the wire service.

232
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:49,250
He's been given 15 years
in Rooker's State Penitentiary.

233
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,625
Parker, how dare you show
your face around here

234
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,208
without bringing
in some hard evidence.

235
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,958
Why, in my day--

236
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,750
Actually, Mr. Jameson,
I do have something.

237
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,458
-What?
-Look!

238
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,958
That stun blaster
that Robbie fired,

239
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,291
he's not pulling the trigger.

240
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,000
Good start, Parker!

241
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,416
You're not as lazy as everyone
around here says.

242
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,375
Thanks, Mr. Jameson.
I'll get right...

243
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,333
This is too important a clue
to leave to an amateur.

244
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,750
I'm going to investigate
this myself.

245
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,833
Just like the good old days.

246
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,000
Jigsaw Jameson is back,

247
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,583
and he's gonna get to the bottom
of this puzzle.

248
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,500
[both] Jigsaw Jameson?

249
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,000
JJ, something tells me
I better keep an eye on you.

250
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,166
Taxi!

251
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,625
[Spider-Man] I hate
being in this suit again,

252
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,625
but there are a lot of
dangerous creeps out there now,

253
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,375
and you may be too rusty
to handle them.

254
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,416
Still, I have
to admire your guts.

255
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,833
Take me to 10th and Bensonhurst.
Now, hurry!

256
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,583
Yeah, okay.

257
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,375
814 reporting in. We're going
to 10th and Bensonhurst.

258
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,250
I still can't believe it!

259
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,375
Jigsaw Jameson,
but you're a big CEO now!

260
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,708
What are you doin' down here?

261
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,125
Same as before.
I need information.

262
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,208
So the person I come
to is Jimmy Mills,

263
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,458
the best beat cop I ever knew.

264
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, baloney, I'm gettin'
too old for this stuff.

265
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,208
But since you're askin'
about high-tech weapons,

266
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,625
Joseph Nails is your man.

267
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,333
Joey Nails? He used to stooly
for me years ago.

268
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,458
He's big time now,
owns some fancy supper club

269
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,000
on the Upper East Side.

270
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,333
It's called Baby Joe's.

271
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,416
Wait here.

272

[dramatic music]

273
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:39,458
So do you still remember
how to make a Newshound Float?

274
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,458
-What?
-You shove him in the river

275
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,250
and toss him a life preserver.

276
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,000
Jigsaw, what are you doing here?

277
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,291
Hello, Nora.

278
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm back on the crime beat,

279
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,458
and I'm here to see Joey Nails.

280
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,166
No, nobody sees Joey
just like that anymore.

281
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,583
He'll see me.

282
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,125
I want to talk
about old times, and new.

283
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,166
Sure. Sure, Jigsaw.
Have a seat.

Well, Jigsaw Jameson.

You never write, you never call.

You're too big
for your old friends now?

Only for two-bit crooks
like you, Nails.

Hey, no fair.
I'm strictly legit now.

Oh, yeah? Then what's
with the fancy chair?

from a geezer like you?

Plenty! For one thing,

299
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,500
I can smell a warehouse storage
record from a mile away.

I always could get
the drop on you, Nails.

Hey, what's this?

307
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,583
Judging by all the attention
Jameson's getting,

308
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,583
he's definitely on to something.

00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,500
That move made me captain

326
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,291
of my college wrestling team.

327
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah, well,
now I'll show you the move

328
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,625
that won me first prize
at my gun club.

329
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,000
[Jonah]
I knew you were in on this.

330
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,125
And after all these years,
I finally realized something.

331
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,750
If you want it done right,
you gotta do it yourself.

332
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,250
Don't you get it?

333
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,458
I was trying to keep
those goons from hurting you.

334
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,875
Yeah? For all I know,
you're just trying

335
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,583
to keep them from fingering you.

336
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,291
When I think of all the times
Robbie tried

337
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,750
to convince me you were
one of the good guys.

338
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,750
-How you framed him like that?
-[spider-sense tingles]

339
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,375
Goodbye, scum.

340
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,500
[Spider-Man] We've gotta get
to a safer place.

341
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,416
This rat-trap
is liable to come down!

342
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,125
It looks
like we hit the jackpot.

343
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,708
Okay, Spider-Man, let's
finish this once and for all.

344
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,250
Unh!

345
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,000
Didn't you ever think
that if Robbie Robertson

346
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,583
thought I was okay,
there might be something to it?

347
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,416
That's just
like the blaster Robbie

348
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,875
was holding in the picture!

349
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,125
This is a remote control unit.

350
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,708
And I'll just bet
it operates the blaster.

351
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,291
This proves
that Robbie was set up.

352
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,333
That tunnel probably
leads to the river

353
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,333
where they secretly ship
the stuff in.

354
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,375
Spider-Man, I'd give anything
to settle your hash right now,

355
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:35,083
but I've got a judge to see,
and a man's life to save.

356
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,875
Well, I've gotta give
old fuzz-head credit.

357
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,625
He never gives up.

358
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,583
But there's more
important things to do here,

359
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,500
like find out
who's behind all this.

360
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,083
This technology is incredible.

361
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,000
For my money,
there's only one guy

362
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,416
who can afford all this:
Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin.

363
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,416
But why would
he do this to Robbie?

364
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:58,166
If I can tap into the Kingpin's
computer network,

365
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,416
maybe I can find the answer.

366
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,416
Great, I can't get
to any of the files on Robbie

367
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,583
until I crack the access code.

368
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:09,208
I'll have to use every hacker's
trick I've ever learned.

369
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,500
[dramatic music]

370
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,875
Come on.

371
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,458
P-R-O-G?

372
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,083
Yes, I'm in!

373
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,000
Now to get some answers.

374
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,333
I was right! The Kingpin
did arrange Robbie's kidnapping

375
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,458
and set him up to take the rap
for that crime.

376
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,833
Robbie's prison
assignment was changed

377
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,625
from New York State Pen
to Rooker's.

378
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,500
But why?

379
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,000
[guard] Robertson.

380
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,500
-[cell door sliding]
-What is it?

381
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,875
Say hello to one
of your new roommates.

382
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,083
Hello, Robbie. How are you?

383
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,625
What?!

384
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,333
Richard Fisk?

385
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,375
Of course! The password!

386
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,125
"Progeny" means offspring,
as in son.

387
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,125
Fisk has only one son--
Richard.

388
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,291
He's been incarcerated
at Rooker's, too,

389
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,958
ever since that time he
tried to frame Peter Parker.

390
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,125
But why would he want
access to Robbie?

391
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,833
Could it have been
something that he did

392
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,708
for somebody else?

393
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,833
Rooker's. Oh, no!

394
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,583
I have to hurry!
Robbie may be in real danger!

395
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,375
This can't be a coincidence!

396
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,333
And neither is this.

397
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,291
Hey, homie, good to see ya.

398

00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,291
into quite the little criminal.

401
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,166
At least I'll have the pleasure

402
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,583
of seeing the Robertson name
go down in flames.

403

-[Robbie groans]
-[laughing]

I'm gonna take you down
once and for all!

405
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,625
And how do you plan
to pull that off?!

406
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,583
Simple, I'm not afraid
of the police!

You okay?

412
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,625
I'd hate to think you weren't
glad to see me

413
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,375
after all the trouble Fisk
went through to get ya here.

414
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,000
You did this to me!

415

Why?! How?!

416
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,375
Hey, take it easy, man!

417
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,458
Fisk just did me a favor
for helping him out

418
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,708
of a few scrapes here in prison.

419
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,416
With his connections,

420
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,458
he brought the whole thing off
without a hitch.

421

What do you want from me?

Hope I'm not too late.

to break into prison

the element of surprise.

-It's Spider-Man!

He's probably coming
for his buddy here!

431
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,250
He's not gonna get him!

432
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,000
I've worked too hard for this!

-Get us out of here!

The prison supply copter
is out in the yard.

437
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,333
And Spider-Man will
be our distraction.

438
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,875
How ironic.

start by surrendering?

that Robbie was involved.

You see, Robbie?

00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,333
It wasn't Spider-Man
who helped you

471
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,708
when you were in trouble,
it was me.

472

I'll never forget what
you've done for me, Jigsaw.

473

I had to do something.

474
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,583
it would've been too much work
to replace you.

475
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,333
I hope you'll change your mind

476
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,333
about taking pictures
of Spider-Man, Peter.

477
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,458
I've never been
more convinced in my life

478
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,000
that Spider-Man is a true hero.

479
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,875
I know his job's not easy,

480
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,500
but he's exactly what this city,

481
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,333
this world, needs right now.

482
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,250
I hope he never gives up.

483
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,333
Okay, Mr. Robertson,
consider my mind changed.
