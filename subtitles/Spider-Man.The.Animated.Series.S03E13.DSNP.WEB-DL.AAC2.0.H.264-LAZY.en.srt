164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,958
I'm going to go talk to him.

165
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,833
Parker, what are you
doing here?

166
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,458
Why aren't you
developing those pictures

167
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,875
of that hole in the sky?

168
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,458
It's all taken care of,
Mr. Jameson.

169
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,500
-Peter!
-I--

170
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,750
Excuse me, Mr. Jameson.

171
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,208
I have to borrow Parker
to say hello to my fiancé.

172
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,708
Sorry, social obligations.

173
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,166
Jason, you remember
Peter Parker.

174
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,458
But of course. Wonderful
to see you again, Parker.

175
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:16,083
Whoa! My spider-sense
is going berserk, but why?

176
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:21,000
Peter Parker, it is so good
to see you looking so healthy.

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,166
Uh, hello, Mr. Fisk.

178
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,583
The Kingpin. He must have set
my spider-sense off.

179
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:30,416
I really must apologize
again for that little mishap

180
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,458
that put you in jail, my boy.

181
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,833
You have no idea
how deeply I regret it.

182
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,416
If you will excuse me.

183
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,416
Oh, Osborn.

184
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:44,000
Personally,
I find these soirees
to be ever so tedious,

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,708
but Felicia absolutely
revels in them.

186
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,833
Did she tell you she's
redecorating the east wing?

187

-[Jason droning on]
-[thinking] My spider-sense

188
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,083
was right about the danger.

189
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm in danger
of being bored to death.

190
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,291
But I'll bet Fisk
and Osborn's conversation

191
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,625
just might be a bit more
enlightening than this drivel.

192
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,083
Uh, could you excuse me
a second, Jason?

193
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,875
Of course, old bean.

194
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,125
[Norman]
Let me get this straight.

195
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,708
The mighty Kingpin
asks my help?

196
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,833
Demands.

197
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:16,333
I need to know
the true identity
of a new associate of mine,

198
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,833
one with whom I am going to rob

199
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,875
the Federal Reserve
gold repository.

200
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,375
How would I know?

201
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,291
Because you created him.

202
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,750
He's the Hobgoblin.

203
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,458
Hobgoblin?

204
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,083
No, I don't want
to talk about him.

205
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,958
I don't want to talk
about any goblins.

206
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,500
-I need to go.
-Go you shall,

207
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,833
once you have
told me who the Hobgoblin is.

208
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,958
Leave me alone!

209
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,458
As you wish, but I cannot
make the same promise

210
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,125
about your son.

211
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,708
Meet me at Oscorp at 2:00 A.M.

212
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:49,708
I'll tell you everything.

213
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,875
[thinking] I'm gonna have
to abandon M.J. again

214
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,875
if I'm gonna stop
that repository heist.

215
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,875
Will Spider-Man always
keep coming between us?

216
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,875
So are you here
to wish me good luck?

217
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,583
Felicia! Uh, yes, good luck.

218
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,458
Do you really love
this Jason Phillips guy?

219
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,333
And why should
you care about that?

220
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,583
Unless you've got
a better offer.

221
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,166
This is crazy.

222
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,875
I can't love one woman
as Peter Parker

223
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,583
and another as Spider-Man.

224
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,833
No, I don't.

225
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,333
I just want you to be happy.

226
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,458
So do I.

00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,291
I'm your friend! [laughs]

There was only one
true goblin,
the Green Goblin!

232
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,958
I'm the Green Goblin,
not that you'll live
long enough

233
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:59,375
for it to matter,

No, not again.

236
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,208
I'm your friend, Norman.

237
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,833
You're not my friend!

238

You're some monster!

239
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:20,458
No, the others,
they're the monsters.

Kingpin, the Hobgoblin,
Spider-Man.

241
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,458
They're all trying
to hurt you,

242
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,833
squeeze you, crush you.

243
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,083
Yes, that's exactly
what they're doing to me.

244
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:37,458
And that's why you
should let me stop them.

245
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,125
It would be wrong.

246
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,208
Wrong is what
they're doing to you

247
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:45,500
and what they want
to do to Harry!

You can! You must!

to be precise.

Former petty crook,
ex-hired thug,

326
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:21,458
and now your husband-to-be.
[laughs]

You're a criminal?

328

No! No, I can't believe that!

329
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,583
Oh, I'm afraid
it's true, my dear.

330
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:31,708
This house, my money,
everything that drew you to me,

331
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,875
it all came from crime.

What have I done?

00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,458
I can't marry you!

Oh, but now that you
know who I am, you must,

335
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,291
or else I can't let you live.

How did you know who I am?

342
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,500
I know all your secrets.

343
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,958
I even know that it was
Norman Osborn who created you,

344
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:03,750
and now I will
undo his mistake.

345
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,583
I'm reclaiming
everything that ever fell

into your misbegotten hands!

347
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,500
Fortunately, I've had access

348
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,125
to the Kingpin's plans
of Ohn's technology.

349
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,500
I've studied up on
how to use this thing.

350

Now get in, both of you.

No, it's too low on power!

We could be trapped in limbo.

Think of it as your big chance

to get away
from it all! [laughs]

355

The Goblin's trail
has gone cold,

356
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,000
but maybe I'll pick it up again

357
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,416
in Norman's old hangout
at Oscorp.

358

[Jason] Look, whatever
Osborn's paying you,

359
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,416
I'll double it, triple it!

360
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,583
You think
I'm in this for money?

361

[Jason] Well, what then?

362
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,875
To make life easier
for my creator, Norman Osborn.

363
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,000
Once I've eliminated
all his enemies,

then he won't have
to suffer anymore.

Because I had nothing
to begin with.
