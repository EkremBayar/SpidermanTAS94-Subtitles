168
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,708
There's more than one
plasma sucker in town now.

169
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,875
I should scan the crowd
for that fruitcake

170
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,375
on the chopper with the
garlic bombs and fangs.

171
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,000
Look, its Spider-man.

172
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,708
He's responsible for this.

173
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:58,500
Get him!

174
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,958
[crowd shouting]

175
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,500
[Spider-man] Its
surprising how quickly

176
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,125
the public will turn on you

177
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,750
when they think you're a
blood draining monster.

178
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,375
Its Spider-man!

179
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,291
[Spider-man] Something
tells me they don't

180
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,166
want my autograph.

181
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,708
I must find Morbius before
that motorcycle freak does.

182
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:16,291
If he gets Morbius first, I
won't be able to clear my name.

183
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,000
Looks like Morbius has found me.

184
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,458
Listen to me, Micheal,

185
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,291
you have to end this nightmare.

186
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,333
I can help.

187
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,708
I don't want your help!

188
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:34,583
When I awoke this
evening, I felt different.

189
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,416
I like this life now.

190
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,500
I cannot be hurt,
cannot be destroyed.

191
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,875
I am immortal!

192
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,833
I have no desire
to be turned back

193
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,000
into a pitiful human.

194
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,958
Now I am so much
more than human.

195
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,125
I am the king of the night.

196
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,708
[shouts]

197
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,458
New strength.

198
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,833
Yes!

199
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,416
[engine revs]

200
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,416
[hisses]

201
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,416
You again.

202
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,375
Who are you?

203
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,000
What do you want with me?

204
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,208
Call me Blade.

205
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,375
And all I want, vampire,

206
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,166
is to destroy you.

207
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,500
[Spider-man] He didn't
get a full plasma drain.

208
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,208
But I still feel weak, dizzy.

209
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,583
[roars]

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,291
This time, vampire,
you're finished.

211
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,000
[Spider-man] Stop!

212
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,833
[engine revving]

213
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,000
Why did you do that?

214
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,333
Why?

215
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,208
[Spider-man] I have to help him.

216
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,583
I turned him into a vampire.

217
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,333
You created that creature?

218
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,208
And now you want to save
him after all he's done?

219
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,583
[Spider-man]
He didn't want to be one.

220
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,458
He must be destroyed

221
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,750
and so must you.

222
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,583
I won't make the mistake of
letting you live this time.

223
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,000
[tense dramatic music]

224
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,375
[screaming]

225
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,958
[crowd screaming]

226
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,458
Oh its, Spider-man.

227
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,458
He looks sick.

228
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,583
Don't touch him.

229
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,333
He might have spider cooties.

230
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,291
[Spider-man] Good thing
that awning broke my fall.

231
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,583
Hey, Spider-man!

232
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,291
Can I have your autograph?

233
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,583
If you get the chair,
it will be worth a fortune.

234
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,750
Fame, it always
goes to their heads.

235
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,291
[Spider-man]
Both of them are gone

236
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,708
and my head is pounding.

237
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,750
You're in top form
tonight, Spidey.

238
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,958
Its hard to admit but
I can't do this alone.

239
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,166
I need help.

240
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,000
But can I trust a vampire
hunter to help me?

241
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,583
-[hisses]
-[woman screams]

242
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,500
Blade, you must be calm.

243
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,125
Whether we defeat the enemy
in one battle or by degrees

244
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,083
the consequences
will be the same.

245
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,000
This vampire is different.

246
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,583
Spider-man told
me he created it.

247
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,125
How is that possible?

248
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,875
Many things are possible.

249
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,708
As much as we have
learned, Blade,

250
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,708
we are still chartering the
course through darkness.

251
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,625
All the attacks occurred
near Empire State University.

252
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,500
Why, Whistler?

253
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,458
[Spider-man] Well maybe he
just likes the cafeteria food.

254
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,375
You, here!

255
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,000
[groaning]

256
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,625
Go ahead, do it.

257
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,583
Prove that you're the
protector of those

258
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,750
inhuman things.

259
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,875
[Spider-man] I'm just
looking for some answers.

260
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,500
Who or what are you?

261
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,708
Blade, let's listen to him.

262
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,000
He may be able to
answer our questions.

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,708
How could you take his side?

264
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,333
I told you, he saved
that vampire's life.

265
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,416
[Spider-man] Just listen to
me and I'll tell you why.

266
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,708
Continue refitting the
weapons on your motorcycle.

267
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,000
Go, go.

268
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,958
As you request, Whistler,

269
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,500
but I'd keep a close eye on him.

270
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,000
If I were you.

271
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,875
Forgive Blade if
he's not very social.

272
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,291
We have worked by
ourselves for a long time.

273
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,583
[Spider-man] Work?
What is it you do?

274
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,000
Are you garlic wholesalers?

275
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,375
Blade and I are vampire hunters.

276
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,083
[Spider-man] Vampire hunters?

277
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,583
There's always been a
dedicated cadre of people

278
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,375
who hunt Nosferatu.

279
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,000
[Spider-man] Nosferatu?

280
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,125
Isn't that the name
of a German rock band?

281
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,416
No, no.

282
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,208
Its an ancient term for vampire.

283
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,291
In my youth I was
trained to fight them

284
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,416
and now I pass those
traditions onto Blade.

285
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,708
He is the son of a vampire
man who fell in love

286
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,708
with a human woman.

287
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:45,000
His mother was later turned
into Nosferatu against her will

288
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,500
but she wanted Blade
spared from her dark world.

289
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,625
It was her final act of love.

290
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:55,125
Blade ran off and soon
discovered that he was blessed,

291
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,375
or cursed, by
being part vampire.

292
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,625
Not all vampire, the
transformation was not total.

293
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:05,083
He has the quickness, the
strength, the agility.

294
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,416
But is unaffected by sunlight

295
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:11,875
and he is immune to the venom
of his bloodsucking brethren.

296
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,625
No he aims to destroy
all those condemned

297
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,625
to a life as a freak of nature

298
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:20,625
and he yearns to find
his mother again.

299
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,833
[Spider-man] I know what
it means to be different.

300
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,333
Its not an easy thing.

301
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,166
I found Blade and I raised him.

302
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,750
I focused his anger
to where it belonged.

303
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,375
Protecting innocent people

304
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,750
from the vampire scourge.

305
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,875
He can match any
Nosferatu in a way

306
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,291
that no human never could.

307
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,375
[woman screaming]

308
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,208
[Spider-man] Are you saying
there are more vampires

309
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,875
out there?

310
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,458
Every country in the
world has those who carry

311
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,208
the mutant gene responsible
for this disease.

312
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,416
[Blade] You've told
him too much already.

313
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,500
No, Blade.

314
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,125
He must know.

315
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,583
The diseases symptoms
include deadly reactions

316
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:07,125
to certain plant life,
alloys, and ultraviolet rays.

317
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,875
Vampires bodies burn
iron too quickly.

318
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,583
They need to steal
plasma to get it.

319
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,583
[Spider-man] Well that
sounds like Morbius.

320
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,083
Who?

321
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,208
[Spider-man] The vampire
we've been chasing.

322
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,875
He's the result of an experiment

323
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,000
with a machine called the
Neogenic Recombinator.

324
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,833
A machine that can
create vampires?

325
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:27,375
Yes, that would explain
his territorial proximity

326
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,750
to ESU.

327
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,166
You must show me
where the machine is.

328
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,958
I have to destroy it.

329
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,333
[Spider-man] Whoa, whoa,
wait a minute, fang face.

330
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,875
I need it to make
Morbius human again.

331
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,958
I won't let you
protect him any longer.

332
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:38,958
Blade!

333
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,458
[explosion]

334
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,000
If Spider-man can
transform Morbius back,

335
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
maybe he can help you, too.

336
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,458
You know that as you age you're
becoming more vampire like,

337
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,083
you crave plasma.

338
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,625
The serum you give me makes
those cravings go away.

339
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,708
Yes but its losing
its effectiveness.

340
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:00,833
This machine could help
you become human again.

341
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,250
I must remain a vampire so
that I can locate my mother

342
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,458
and I'll destroy anything
that gets in my way.

343
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:11,166
I am and will always
be a vampire hunter.

344
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:14,416
Then you must learn how to
act out of what is right.

345
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:18,208
Not to satisfy your
uncontrollable lust for revenge.

346
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,375
[Peter] Unlike the
myths about vampires,

347
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,166
its not a simple piece of
garlic that Blade uses,

348
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,583
its combined with rare
bacteria.

349
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,625
Telephone, Peter.

350
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,625
Its Mary Jane.

351
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,458
Oh, thanks Aunt May.

352
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,083
[Peter Voiceover] No,
I've been dreading this.

353
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,875
Young love.

354
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,875
[screaming]

355
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:41,875
[Peter Voiceover] She looked
at me with such horror

356
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:42,708
when I was Man-Spider.

357
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,458
Stay back!

358
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,000
[Peter Voiceover] I'm
afraid to ever bring

359
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,458
that monster into
our life again.

360
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,416
Hi, I uh, I've been
meaning to call you

361
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,458
since I got back.

362
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,708
But uh.

363
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,166
No excuses, Peter.

364
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,583
The police want to
meet at Lehman Hall

365
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,500
with friends of students
who've taken ill.

366
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,083
You should be here.

367
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,833
We could talk
afterwards, over dinner.

368
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:03,875
[Peter Voiceover]
Maybe I can get a clue

369
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,583
to Morbius' whereabouts.

370
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,208
Okay, I'll meet you there.

371
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,083
[Lee] I'm glad you all came

372
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,000
because we have a very
serious situation here.

373
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,583
Spider-man, Morbius'
disappearance.

374
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:20,166
The plasma disease,
this vampire story.

375
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,208
I just know they're linked

376
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,416
but I can't find the thread
that connects them all together.

377
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,333
Well better late
than never, tiger.

378
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,875
At least you showed.

379
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,166
Sorry I was--

-Parker!
-Lieutenant Lee.

381
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,375
You always find
Spider-man fast enough

382
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,000
to get pictures of him.

383
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,875
Why don't you tell me
where I can find him?

384
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,208
It doesn't work that way.

385
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,958
What's with you?

386
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,875
You're protecting your
income while innocent people

387
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,875
are being hurt.

388
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,416
No, I'm not trying to--

389
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,458
By the way, I understand
you and Ms. Hardy here

390
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,333
were an item before
Micheal Morbius showed up.

391
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,583
You seem to be
benefiting all around.

392
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,458
That's not true.

393
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,500
Felicia, wait.

394
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,708
I'm not finished with you.

395
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,083
Well then book me or let me go.

396
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,458
But I don't have
to listen to this.

397
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,000
Fine, you can go.

398
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Just remember, I'm watching you.

Oh, Peter.

I miss Micheal so much.

403
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,708
This is tearing me up inside.

404
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,500
[Peter Voiceover]
I feel terrible.

405
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,416
It was my blood that
turned him into a vampire.

406
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,416
I'll do whatever I can
to bring Micheal back.

407
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,416
I promise.

408
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,458
Mary Jane, are you okay?

409
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,125
I'm fine.

410
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,500
Harry, how would you like
to take a gal to dinner?

411

I had other plans but
I just canceled them.

Well sure, I'd love to.

413
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,125
This is a game you
cannot win, Mr. Parker.

414
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:46,125
I drain away the very
marrow of your being.

415
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:49,166
No, Felicia cannot
see me this way.

416
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,458
Can you walk me
to my car, Peter?

417
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,416
Sure.

418
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,500
No problem.

but it will do the job.

I had only planned to
destroy the Recombinator.

How fortunate I get to
destroy you as well.

I'm now stronger than you
and Spider-man combined.

There are others
like me, Morbius.

You will never be safe!

And soon, thanks to
the Recombinator,

00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,375
there will be many more like me.

The whole world will
become vampires.

will be the freaks.

held him this time.

[Spider-man] I borrowed
some vampire repellent gas

451
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,083
from you and mixed
it into my webbing.

452
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,875
But I watered it down
because I want Morbius alive.

453
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,416
I thought it would hold
him a little longer.

Good try, Spider-man
