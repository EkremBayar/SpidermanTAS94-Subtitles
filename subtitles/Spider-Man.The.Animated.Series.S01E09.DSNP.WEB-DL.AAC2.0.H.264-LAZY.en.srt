Now, I'll add a molecule
chain from that suit of yours.

They're bonding.

151
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,625
It's replicating and mutating

by bonding with another.

In this case, me.

160

But not only does
the suit bond,

is a sentient creature.

You mean it thinks?

Where do you think
you're going?

166

You've got to get
that suit off!

I can't, not yet.

I have some things I have
to take care of first.

[Dr. Connors] Get rid of it!

[groans]

172
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:53,416
It's gone... the man
in a rhino costume.

[groans]

174
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,291
There was a guy
in a rhino suit.

175
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,750
You lied to me!

176
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,458
OK, OK,
it was just some fool

177
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,583
in a bad Halloween costume.

178
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,875
What's the big deal?

179
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,708
I can't have someone
who works for me

180
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,625
coloring the truth
and leaving out facts.

181
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,708
It's against
everything I stand for.

182
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,291
You're history, Brock!

183
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,375
Outta here! Fired!

184
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,208
What? No, no, wait!

185
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,833
I have more pictures.

186

Out!

187
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,875
Come on, you hate Spider-Man,
both of us do.

188
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,708
I thought you'd be
glad to hear he took

189
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:26,000
the Promethium X.
JJ, I did it for you.

190
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,625
You did this
for yourself, Brock.

191
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,583
Get me security, I've got
some trash they can throw out.

192
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,500
Because Eddie Brock,
an ex-Bugle reporter withheld

193
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,875
important evidence
in this case,

194
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:44,125
I must regretfully withdraw
my reward for the capture of

195
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,958
Spider-Man until this matter

196
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,875
has been thoroughly
investigated.

197
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,875
Who is this Eddie Brock?

198
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,333
We have to make sure
that none of this

199
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,708
can be traced back to me.

200
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,166
I've got the perfect device,

201
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,875
and the perfect man to use it.

202
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:04,958
Spider-Man, everywhere
I turn he's in my way.

203
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,083
He cost me my job,
my reputation,

My apartment?

206
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,083
[Spider-Man thinking]
Now for a little game

207
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,583
of hide and seek.

208
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,958
I figure Brock's hidden
that film of the rhino

209
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,875
in here somewhere,
and I'm gonna find it.

210
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,708
Come on, Brock, where is it?

211
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,625
Not too hygienic,
you know, but clever.

212
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,166
And now Mr. Brock
will learn a serious lesson

213
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,291
about the dangers of lying.

214
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,458
[man]
You Eddie Brock?

215
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,458
[Brock] Who wants to know?

216
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,583
My boss wants to know.

217

[Spider-Man thinking]
What's this about?

218
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,500
This is why they
call me The Shocker.

219
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:06,000
So, very painful, or sort of
painful, it's up to you.

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,125
Where are the photos
of the crash site?

221
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,000
What's this, a fight,
and nobody invited me?

222
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You stay out of this?

223
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,458
Reasonable advice.

224
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,500
But I haven't had much
use for reason lately.

225
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,625
Getting rid of you
is gonna be a blast!

Rest in pieces, wall crawler.

How about I follow you instead?

229
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,875
All right, Shocker,
which door did you use?

230
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:50,083
You can confuse my eyes,
but not my spider sense.

231

Did you take care of Mr. Brock?

No, he got away.

I can crawl through

That's the old Spidey talking.

I did smash Spider-Man though.

Oh, well, if it isn't my
old friend Allister Smithe.

How did you get in here?

so hot for this little rock.

Spider-Man took
the Promethium X.

come running when you call?

And you,
you're the main course.

325
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,583
You'll pay for this.

326
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,125
The check's in the mail, baby.

327
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,125
Oh! What are you trying...

328
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,625
No. I give up.

329
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,416
Come on.

330
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,708
You're supposed to be the
good guy, you can't do this!

331
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,750
Why not?

332
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,875
I have the power.

333
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,583
Ah, my Uncle Ben,
he always used to tell me,

334
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,500
with great power comes
great responsibility.

335

[screams]

340
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,875
What's this costume doing?

341
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,416
Doc Connors was right,
the symbian's taking control.

342
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,416
I gotta get it off.[groans]

343
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,500
Oh, it's too late,
it won't let me.

[church bell rings loudly]

345
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:50,708
This suit is in pain,
I can feel it, why?

346
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,083
[groans] Sonic vibrations!

347
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,166
Noise makes you crazy,

348
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,250
I should've
guessed that before.

349
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,250
Why didn't I know
your weakness?

350
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,708
Did you block it from my mind

351
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,291
to protect yourself?

352
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,416
Was Connors right?

353
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,333
Stay away from me.

354
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,166
I thought I wanted
what you had to offer,

355
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,708
but I'm not like you, and I
won't let you do this to me.

356
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:25,833
No!

[Peter thinking]
At last, it's over.

359
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,166
I gotta get out of here.

360
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,000
[groans]

361
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,083
I have it!

362
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:59,750
Now, gentlemen, what am I bid?

363
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,875
Wait a minute, first you
need to prove to us again

364
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,708
that this is the real stuff.

365
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:05,875
As you wish.

366
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,458
Eh! What are you
trying to pull now?

367
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,833
This Promethium X is almost

368
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,333
completely transmuted
into lead.

369
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,875
How could that have happened?

370
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,750
It appears to be
the nature of Promethium X,

371
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,875
it's radioactive half-life
must be only days.

372
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,708
Why didn't you tell
me this before?

373
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,458
Because you never gave me
an opportunity to study it.

374
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,958
Then it's useless!

375
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:46,208
He knew it, Spider-Man knew it.
