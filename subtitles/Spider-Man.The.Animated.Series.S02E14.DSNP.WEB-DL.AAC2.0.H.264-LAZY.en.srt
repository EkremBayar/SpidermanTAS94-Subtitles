Help!

00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,833
Help me!

[Peter thinking] Good.

173
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,708
Aunt May won't hear me
come in.

174
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,000
[John] You tell Parker
I pay him to take photos,
not sick days.

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,958
That Vulture lunatic
just attacked

176
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:30,291
my good friend, Norman Osborn,
and we don't have any photos!

177
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:34,125
[Peter] All right, I, um,
when he's feeling better,

178
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,166
I'll give him the message.

179
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,458
Give him this message, too.

180
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,750
No matter what,
he's got a job to do

181
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,458
and he's expected to do it!

182
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,000
Who was that, Jonah?

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,958
Some relative of Parker's
calling in sick for him.

184
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,500
Robbie, why is it that having
no sense of responsibility

185
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,708
goes hand in hand
with being young?

186
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:58,583
[Peter thinking] I hate to
admit it, but Jameson's right.

187
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,333
I do have a job to do.

188
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,083
People are depending on me.

189

[Dr. Connors] What you're
telling me is unbelievable,

191
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:11,458
but maybe there's a chance
I can help you.

192
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,125
Can you meet me at
Toomes's neogenic lab

193
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,583
first in the morning?

194
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,458
Wouldn't miss it
for the world, Doc.

[phone beeps]

00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:18,958
Help me!

Help me! [pants]

You don't understand,
none of you do.

He's after me...
The Scorpion!

203
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,083
No!
Don't do this to me!

204
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,250
-[man 1] He's like this
every night.
-Please!

205
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,875
[man 2] What's his story?

206
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,208
-[man 1] Remember The Scorpion?
-[man 2] Yeah.

207
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,458
-[man 1] Well, Stillwell's

208
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,750
the one who created him.

209
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,333
No way, this guy?

210
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,416
[man 1] He was a genius.

211
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,958
Right on the cutting edge.

212
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,875
[man 2]
Well, he's over the edge now.

213
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,125
[Farley] No.

214
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,375
[Farley] No!

Oh, but I am, pally.

220
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:18,083

could I do this?

Please, don't hurt me!

223
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:25,083
Stillwell,
I've had time to think

224
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,583
about what you've done to me,

225
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,166
and guess what I've decided.

226
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:34,500
Since I'm your creation,
I'm your responsibility.

227
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,125
Oh.

228
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,875
You got to turn me back
into the man I was!

229
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,708
I want to be plain
old Mac Gargan again!

230
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,708
What can I do for you here?

231
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,458
[Scorpion] Not here,
at Toomes Aerodynamics.

232
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,500
Who the...

233
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500

Help!
Call the police!

236
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,458
Come on, Stillwell.

237
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,083
Now that I've got you,
I'm gonna make it

238
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,416
so both our nightmares
are gonna end.

-What?

242
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,000
It's me, Adrian Toomes.

243
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,166
And it's time for you
to start earning

244
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,208
that grant I gave you.

245
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,708
These talons sucked
the youth force

246

out of Spider-Man
and made me young,

247
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,291
but there's something wrong.

248
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,458
I... [groans]

00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,875
[screams]

250
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,833
No! No!

251
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,583
Not again!

252
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,458
Connors,
what's happening to me?

253
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,458
Why haven't I changed
back into my old self?!

254
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,208
This has to be the result
of your contact
with Spider-Man.

255
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,875
When you sapped his youth,

256
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,583
you must've also
absorbed his mutated DNA

257
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,000
and it's too unstable
to let you change back.

258
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,083
What?!

259
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,500
Spider-Man had a disease

260
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,208
that I was treating
with neogenics.

261
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,875
The only way to cure you

262
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,875
is to transfer the mutating DNA
back into him.

263
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,708
No other human
body can handle it.

264
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,875
It's too late!

265
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,458
Spider-Man's been destroyed!

266
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,583
But I just heard from him.

267
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,625
You did?

268
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,625
-When?

what are you doing here?

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,875
Oh, I was kidnapped.

271
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,458
-He--
-Quiet!

272
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,375
What's with them wings?

273
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,500
And how come you're wearing
that dumb green costume?

274
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,000
You some kind of a nut?

275
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Who are you?

276
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,208
How dare you disturb us!

277
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,583
Now, tell me where
Spider-Man is!

278
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,875
[Dr. Connors] I don't know.

279
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,583
Where is he?

280
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,333
No!

281
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,125
No!

282
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,583
I might need you later.

283
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,833
Aah! Scorpion, stop!

284
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,958
You'll destroy
the neogenic files!

285
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,375
You need them!

286
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,166
[Vulture] Fascinating.

287
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,708
You want the neogenic data,
and I want Spider-Man.

288
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,500
Who are you, anyway?

289
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,291
I can give you access
to the neogenic computers,

290
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,125
but you must help me
get Spider-Man.

291
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,708
[Scorpion] You need help?

292
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,958
I'm suffering from
a temporary ailment

293
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,375
that makes my powers
unreliable.

294
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,708
You can be my insurance
that Spider-Man

295
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,875
will pose no threat to us.

296
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,375
Do we have a deal?

297
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,458
I could make you do
what I want,

298
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:41,708
but I'd plan to squash
Spider-Man sooner or later
anyway.

299
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,708
It's a deal.
So, where is he?

300
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,125
He knows.

301
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,416
[Scorpion]
Better tell us, pally.

302
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,208
Huh, looks like
I don't have a choice.

303
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,166
He's due here any minute.

304
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,958
[Peter thinking] The
worst part of all this is

305
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,583
I can't be there with Mary Jane

306
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,166
when she meets her father.

307
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,958
But at least,
I'll leave her a note.

308
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,625
It's amazing how aging 50 years
can change your plans.

309
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,333
[Peter gasps]
Mary Jane.

310
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,833
You know me?

311
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,833
[Peter]
I'm, I'm making a big mistake.

312
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,625
Are you-- Who are you?

313
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,416
Are you my father?

314
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,708
Wait, don't leave me again.

315
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,416
[Peter thinking]
My own life's a mess,

316
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,750
and now, I'm ruining
Mary Jane's too.

317
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,250
Oh, what else could go wrong?

318
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,750
[horn honking]

319
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,000
Even my spider-sense is gone.

320
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,458
[Aunt May] Oh, you poor fellow.

321
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,708
Are you all right?

322
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,208
[Peter thinking] Oh, no.

323
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,458
Aunt May.

324
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,000
[Aunt May]
Have another, won't you?

325
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,166
[Peter thinking]
Oh, thank heavens,

326
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,708
she doesn't recognize me.

327
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,875
I'm grateful for everything.

Game time's over.

You've been at this for hours.

How much longer will it take
to reconfigure the talons?

There, finished.

364

Now, you can use
the talons to transfer

your unstable mutagenic DNA
back into Spider-Man.

Fix him already, Connors.

Then you and Stillwell
can fix me!

No mistake.

pull any tricks on me.

[Dr. Connors] Farley,
what are you doing?

391
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,625
If I enter the right equations,

392
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,875
it'll overload
the recombinator's transformer

393
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,125
and it'll self-destruct!

394
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,875
I'll make sure that
monsters like The Scorpion

395
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,000
are never created
by neogenics again!

Too late, Connors.

It's going into
self-destruct mode now!

Terrific, better than
I've ever felt before!

But how did you do that?

429
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,750
When I caused your youth
energy to return to you,

430
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,250
I made the mutating aspect
of your DNA stay
in The Vulture.

431
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,375
You regained your
youth and superpowers,

432
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,291
but you'll never have
to worry about mutating

into the man-spider again.

00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:02,583
So, the nightmare of neogenics
is finally over.

But, Farley, I still
needed to cure myself.

I'm sorry, Connors,

but you were right
all those months ago,

not worth the risk.
