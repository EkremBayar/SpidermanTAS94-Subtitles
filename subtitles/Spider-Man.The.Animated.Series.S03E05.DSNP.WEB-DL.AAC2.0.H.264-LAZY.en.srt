How nice.

165
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,375
That sounds delightful.

166
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,750
I know that, Robert,
but I still think

167
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,583
you should keep up
with your science class.

168
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,583
We've been
through all that, Mama.

169
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,166
-You need my help
here a lot more.
-[door bell jingles]

170
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,708
[man]
She needs help all right,

171
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,583
the kind of help
we can give her.

172
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,250
See, lady, all kinds of things
can happen in this world.

173
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,708
[loud crashing]

174

-[man laughs]

175
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,958

-Robert!

176
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,083
[man laughing]

177
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,500
[men cheering]

178
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,125
Why are you doing this to us?!

179
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,833
Why?!

180
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:56,833
We want you to pay us to
protect you, okay, store lady?

181
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,250
If you don't come up
with ten times this amount,

182
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,583
we might have to have
a neighborhood bonfire

183
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,333
and use your store as fuel.

184
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,208
Mama, you better go
lie down and rest.

185
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,958
Yes, I must.

186
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,333
Let me clean this mess up.

187
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,000
Thank you, Robert.

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,166
You're such a good boy.

189
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,625
[Peter] Hey, guy.

190
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,708
What happened here?

191
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,750
Nothing.

192
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,500
Just a small earthquake.

193
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,708
Miss Hardy told me what
happened to you last night.

194
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,250
Is there anything
I can do to help?

195
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,333
No.

196
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,250
We can fend for ourselves.

197
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,833
And I don't have time for
that science center anymore.

198
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,458
But I thought science was
an important part of your life.

199
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,125
What you don't realize, Dukes,

200
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,625
is that brothers like me
don't need science.

201
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:40,125
We've got to think more
about how to survive,
any way we can.

202
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,208
Now leave me alone.
I have work to do.

203
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,583
[thinking]
I seem to be striking out

204
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,750
all over these days.

205
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,583
He's making a big mistake

206
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,250
if he thinks education
isn't a key to survival.

207
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,375
There's got to be some way

208
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,125
I can make him
understand that.

209
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,333
But how?

210
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,333
[both groan]

211
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,750
Hey, watch where
you're going, punk.

212
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,291
-Uh, I'm s-- sorry.
-Now, beat it!

213
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:43,291
Raiders, I congratulate
you on our latest triumph.

214
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,416
Thanks to our precision
and timing,

215
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,833
Spider-Man was
hopelessly outmaneuvered,

216
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:52,500
and, as usual,
the police were useless.

217
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,958
A new ring?

218
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,166
-Yeah, like it?
-Interesting.

219
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,708
However, I recommend
you hold off

220
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,625
buying any more jewelry
with our earnings,

221
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,708
since our next target will
be the Diamond District,

222
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,625
and all your purchases
will be on the house.

223
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,000
[laughter]

224
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The credo I live by
as a master thief

225
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,083
is the same one I believed in

226
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,625
when I was
an aeronautical engineer:

227
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,083
timing is everything.

228
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:22,625
Fortunately, I gave up
government work just in time

229
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,333
to use
this top secret technology

230
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,583
for more lucrative ventures.

231
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,000
-[laughter]
-Sounds like a good idea, boss.

232
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:33,958
Incredible.

233
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,208
Hope they won't miss
a few pieces of equipment.

234
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,500
[camera beeping]

235
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,875
Everyone wants me
to get back into science?

236
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,291
Cool.

237
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,291
I'm with that.

238
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,291
But this time,
it's going to pay.

239
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,583
[knock on door]

240
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,416
- Hi, Mama.
- Oh, Robert,

241
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,125
I am so glad to see you
working on your project again,

242
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,291
not going out into the streets

243
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,083
and getting yourself
into trouble.

244
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,208
Science is your real future.

245
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,333
No kidding.

246
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,166
Well, I'm gonna go lie down.

247
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,000
-Keep up the good work.
-Don't worry, Mama.

248
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,458
I will.

[rockets whooshing]

00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,416
Great!

251
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,250
The gyros, the magnetic wheels,
and boot clamps,

252
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,333
they all really work!

253

I can cling to buildings

-Oh, Robert.

No son of mine is going
to become a criminal.

It would destroy me, Robert.

[Spider-Man]
A little bug told me.

00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,500
But what's with breaking
into jewelry stores?

332
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,416
Wasn't getting arrested once
enough to teach you your lesson?

333
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,416
The lesson is to survive, man.

334
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,125
It's not an easy thing
down here.

I bet when you take
off that mask and go home,

to this neighborhood.

See, I didn't steal anything,
but everyone thinks I did.

When she saw Robert in costume

That voltage cable could
be just what we need.

383
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,416
I'll bet the gyroscopes
he uses are electrically driven.

384
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,833
That's how they
can be precisely timed.

385
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,000
[Spider-Man] Good thinking.

386
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,416
One big jolt of electricity

387
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,375
might short-circuit
the stabilizers.

388
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,083
[Robert]
That could ruin the timing

389

and make the big wheel
roll out of control.

My smarts helped
to get us out of that one.

401
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,333
I guess it pays to know
science stuff after all,

402
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,875
and to use
what you know responsibly.

that Jackson Weele character,

to everything.

thought I was a thief,

it just seemed like
the easiest way to help out

was to become one for real,
