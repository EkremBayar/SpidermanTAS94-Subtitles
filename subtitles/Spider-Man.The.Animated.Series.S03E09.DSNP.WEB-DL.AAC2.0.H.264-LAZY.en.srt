-Randy, you don't have to--
-You just don't understand.

163
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,416
[Spider-man]
Well, looks like Robbie's
got the bad news already.

164
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,416
-[phone ringing]
-Hello.

165
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,166
-[Tombstone]
Hey, homey, what's up?
-Who is this?

166
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:30,000
Don't tell me you've forgotten
my voice, Mr. Straight Arrow.

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,750
Lonnie? But it can't be.
I thought you were...

168
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,708
Don't be so sure I'm not.

169
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,708
I wanna meet
and talk about old times.

170
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,500
I... I can't right now.

171
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,458
Oh, yes, you can.

172
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,416
See, I especially wanna rap
about a good friend of mine,

173
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:48,333
a foxy lady by the name
of Alisha Silvermane.

174
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,833
What's wrong with Robbie?

175
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,583
He looks like
he's seen a ghost.

176
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:55,208
Meet me at Veteran's
Memorial Park, midnight.

177
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,250
Something urgent's
come up at the Bugle.

178
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,875
I have to go.

179
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,333
Yeah, something urgent's
always coming up.

180
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,625
You go straight to your room!

181
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,875
We'll continue this
when I get back.

182

[crickets chirping]

183
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,458
[Spider-Man]
This is a cheery little spot.

184
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,291
I'm glad I came along
for the ride.

185
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,833

187
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,708
Lonnie, you here?

188
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,291
[Tombstone] I'm here.

189
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,000
I still can't
believe you're alive.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,708
-Am I?
-Oh, what happened to you?

191
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:35,083
Oh, this?
Just a little mishap.

192
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,708
You haven't changed
much, though.

193
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,750
Still a straight arrow.

194
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,958
Robbie and Tombstone? Buddies?

195
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,166
I want the Silvermane story
buried, Robbie.

196
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,583
What makes you
think I'd do that?

197
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,958
Raah!
You owe me, remember?

198
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,166
You're an old friend, Robbie,

199
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,875
but if you don't kill
that story on your own,

200
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,000
-I'll make you do it.
-No way!

201
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,750
Always the straight arrow.

202
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,375
Ohh!

203
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,208
-You again!
-Revoltin', isn't it?

204
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,000
[groans]

205
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I was sloppy last time,
crypt keeper.

206
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,583
This time,
I'm at the top of my game.

207
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,125
[grunting]

208
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,291
Now I'm gonna prepare
a coffin for you.

209
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,583
A real flat one, brother.

210
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,875
[grunts]
He ain't my brother,
he's heavy.

211
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,208
Ooh!

212
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,458
Oh!

213
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,083
No!

214

[dramatic music]

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,375
It seems like you're
always saving my tail.

[gasp] Look!

Rest in pieces.

218
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,125
Looks like Tombstone got away.

219
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,000
How do you even
know somebody like that?

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,875
You know,
I've been asking myself

221
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,000
the same question
for the last hour.

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I knew Tombstone way
before he was Tombstone.

223
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
His real name
is Lonnie Lincoln.

224
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,958
Closed? Dang!

225
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,583
You know, it's your fault
we're too late, Straight Arrow.

226
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,583
And I'm dying for
an ice cream sandwich, Lonnie!

227
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,083
If you weren't so busy
getting your homework done...

[glass shattering]

229
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,625
Hey! Well, what a shame.

230
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,583
Some dishonest thieves
could just reach in

231
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,458
and grab some ice cream
if you give me a boost.

232
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,000
What?! No way!

233
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,875
This is me who's asking you.

234
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,083
We're like family, remember?

235

-[police siren]
-[grunts]

236
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,166
I managed to get away.

237
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,750
But Lonnie went right
to juvenile court.

238
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,000
[siren]

239
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,166
I eventually
graduated with honors.

240
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:07,500
But Lonnie,
he got a different degree.

241
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,333
I've always felt guilty that
I got away and Lonnie didn't.

242
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,583
And I felt even guiltier
knowing that Lonnie

243
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,416
never gave my name
to the police.

244
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,291
Back then, even one strike
could ruin your life.

245
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,083
I often wonder
what would have happened

246
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,833
if I'd gotten caught
instead of Lonnie.

247
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:27,333
Later, I got a job
as a cub reporter
at a local paper.

248
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,875
One night,
I got a tip on a break-in

249
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,708
at the Spalding chemical plant.

250
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,166
I thought the story
would be my big chance.

251
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,875
-Whaddaya say, Straight Arrow?
-Lonnie?

252
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,500
So, after all
your fancy schools

253
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,458
and your cushy little job,
you can still remember my name?

254
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,458
I'm touched.
In fact, I'm so touched,

255
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,500
I even got
a little gift for you.

256
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,875
I'm gonna give you
a chance to experience life

257
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,958
on the other side
of the tracks.

258
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,625
What are you talking about?

259
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,583
I told you on the phone
there'd be a break-in.

260
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,833
I can even name
the one who broke in.

261
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,958
Joseph "Robbie" Robertson.

262
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,583
I mean, look around,
your prints are everywhere.

263
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,125
You really
should've come prepared.

264
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,958
Why are you doing this?

265
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,208
Why'd you let me get caught
robbing that grocery store?

266
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,708
Is that what this is about?

267
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,458
I took the fall for you, man!

-[glass shatters]
-[fire alarm ringing]

Now it's your turn
to take the rap.

270
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,833
And when you get out of jail,
we'll be family again.

'Cause no one else
will hire you.

00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,875
Aah! Aah!

274
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,875
Aaah!

275
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,875
There was nothing
I could do for him.

[sirens]

277
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,625
I waited
for the police to arrive

278
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,291
and hoped they'd
believe my story.

279
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:50,958
Luckily the guys at the paper
backed me up on the phone tip.

280
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,291
I didn't think
Lonnie survived.

281
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,833
-They told me he was...
-Maybe they really thought so.

282
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,000
He sure looks it.

283
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,833
Anyway, he came back.

284
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:02,166
I had no idea he'd
become this underworld hit man,

285
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,958
this walking tombstone.

286
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,458
Right now, I just wanna get
back to my wife and son.

287
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,375
[thinking] It's so strange
to see Robbie this way.

288

To Peter Parker, he always
seems so strong, so proud.

289
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,583
How ironic that in
his moment of despair,

290
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,166
he seems stronger
to me now more than ever.

I wanna talk to you.

Hey, kid, you and me
are gonna be good friends.

I'm going to look
for Tombstone.

You should get back
to your family.

[Tombstone] We've still got
lots of catching up to do.

How 'bout this:
there's a new patsy

Everything's gonna be
all right.

and you have got
to tell me what it is.

Haven't I always stood by you?

You have,
and if anything happens to me,

315

you've got to stand
by Randy as well.

Robbie, what are you doing?!

the wrong path.

This stuff's worth a fortune,

and Tombstone says we're
gonna get a big cut.

So, the Posse's
working for Tombstone.
