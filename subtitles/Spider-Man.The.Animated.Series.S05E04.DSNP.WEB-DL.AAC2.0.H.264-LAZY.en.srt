78

Dr. Reinstein was lost.

to the super-soldier serum.

80
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:42,583
The only known copy of
it had been in that lab.

81
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,958
A team of scientists tried
to re-create the formula.

82
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:49,875
They wanted to make an
army of super-soldiers.

83
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,583
But because of wartime
chemical shortages,

84
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:56,708
only five more doses
could be synthesized.

85
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,625
So, five young
volunteers were found

to become America's new heroes.

87

However, the new process was
discovered to be unstable.

Miraculously, no one was hurt.

obviously too dangerous

to ever be used again.

And yet, there was
an amazing result.

Each volunteer was
affected differently.

was so increased,

to duplicating

101
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,708
However, the five
new heroes discovered

102
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,875
that their powers
weren't permanent.

103
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,583
They would wear
off after a time.

104
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,458
The scientists
deduced that some day

105
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,625
those powers would
cease altogether.

106
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:57,125
So, to ration their use,
they created ring devices

107
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:00,375
to turn the powers
on only when needed.

108
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,000
Only Captain America's
powers were permanent,

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,458
since he was the only one
who took Reinstein's formula.

110

He was the true super-soldier.

Soon the others took names
to suit their new identities.

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,291
We know about project Doomsday.

164
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,708
We're here to pull the plug.

165
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,708
-I think not!
-[weapon whooshing]

166
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:59,083
This energy vortex will
keep you trapped forever!

167
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,125
-Cap!
-Stay back!

168
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,625
All of you!

169
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,333
We are evenly matched,
you cannot escape.

170
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,750
Maybe, but I can see to
it that you're not around

171
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,333
to activate this atrocity.

172
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,000
-Something
-[Miss America exclaiming]

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,708
[Spider-Man] Captain
America sacrificed himself

174
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,583
so that the Doomsday
device would never be used.

175
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,708
Do I have the guts to make
that kind of sacrifice?

176
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,708
Pray that I never
have to find out.

177
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,000
The machine's advanced
power source was perpetual.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,708
Cap and the Skull would
remain in stasis indefinitely.

179
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,750
-Now what do we do?
-We can't just

180
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,250
keep this our little secret!

181
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,333
Can't we?

182
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,083
After much arguing,

183
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,166
The Five decided they
could keep it a secret.

184
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,166
They divided the six
keys among themselves.

185
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,500
Except for the Black Marvel,
who, by luck of the draw,

186
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,333
took the remaining two.

187
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,583
And they all vowed to find a way

188
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,875
to one day free Captain America.

189
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,250
What happened to them?

190
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,875
Of course,
they then got distracted

191
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,875
by the business of
winning the war.

192
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:59,083
But when the war ended,
they received a rude shock.

193
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,625
They were ordered to disband.

194
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,250
The war department feared
their dwindling powers

195
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,708
would prove to be a liability.

196
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,458
[Miss America]
Now what do we do?

197
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,875
[Black Marvel] I plan to
devote my life to research

198
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,875
that might some day save Cap.

199
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,958
Cap is gone for good!

200
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,708
I'll never abandon Cap!

201
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,750
I'm gonna protect the
site to my dying day!

202
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,708
[Omar Mosley] When they
couldn't reach an agreement,

203
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:24,125
they all moved on,
the war became part of history,

204
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,833
and the warriors, they were
forgotten as things are.

205
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,291
In time,
The Six Forgotten Warriors.

206
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,875
I decided to help Dan Lyons
in his scientific pursuits

207
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,708
to save Captain America.

208
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,708
I went to college and
became a scientist.

209
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,083
He put me in charge of
one of his companies

210
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,208
that was doing research
on vortex phenomena.

211
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,958
But Dan died, and so
I started teaching.

212
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,708
Professor Mosley was the
hardest teacher I ever had,

213
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,166
but we became friends,
and years later,

214
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,875
he confided his story to me.

215
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,333
What about the keys?

216
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,958
-Where are they?
-They're in a safe place.

217
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,083
The Six kept their
identity secret.

218
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,958
Today they could be anywhere,
if they're still alive.

219
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,083
[Peter Voiceover] I get it now.

220
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,708
When My parents found Groitzig,

221
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,708
he wanted to disable
the Doomsday device,

222
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,500
but he needed the six keys.

223
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,000
My parents must have found
the secret identities

224
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,833
of the American Six for him.

225
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,708
But someone stopped them

226
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,875
before they could get
Groitzig out of the country.

227
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,291
And Groitzig spent the next
20 years fearing for his life.

228
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:27,125
Omar, this Doomsday device,
what is it?

229
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,458
Only The Red Skull knew that.

230
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,500
But what I do know is

231
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,708
someone is after the keys
to the Doomsday complex.

232
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:38,750
And if they get them,
the world is in dire peril.

233
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,833
[Spider-Man] That
someone is the Kingpin.

234
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,708
He has everything he needs
and I have no way to stop him.

235
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,875
I'm stuck waiting to see
what he throws at us next.

arch enemy Silvermane.

-Are you the traitor?
-No, I swear it ain't me.

239

Well one of you has
betrayed me once

240

the information inside this box

should make me powerful enough
to squash all my enemies.

every database in the country.

or even a dog, we'll find them!

249

find those keys.

These are keys.

255

The base of each statue
contains a pin tumbler key

This house.

Ah, it all goes back
to over 50 years ago.

380
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,375
It was in the late 1930's.

Ben Parker and I always
wanted to be heroes.

It was all we thought
about when we were young.

00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,583
Well, almost all
we thought about.

00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:25,833
Nora Sharp was also
on both our minds.

385

We were both head over
heels in love with her.

At first, Ben had
the inside track.

387
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,333
But then the war started

388
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,250
and I was chosen
to be in a project

389
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,291
which would turn me
into a real superhero.

390
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,208
Against orders, I told Nora.

391
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,416
She was enthralled.

392
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,458
Ben couldn't compete with it.

Then Nora and I married
during the war.

00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,833
Did she love The Destroyer
or Keene Marlow?

I was in paradise,

00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,166
but paradise never
lasts for very long.

399
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,458
It was not until 1946,

400
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,458
right after the war ended,

401
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,875
when I told Nora my
powers weren't permanent.

402
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,583
She begged me to give
up being a superhero,

but I couldn't!

I continued to work in
secret for the government.

Then one night,

408
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,166
I let my beautiful wife down.

409
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,291
I saw a bank being robbed.

410
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,583
I activated my power.

411
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,375
It was an impetuous
fool hardy thing to do.

[guns firing]

My wife was caught
in the crossfire.

How ironic.

415
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,375
I've become The Destroyer,
all right.

416
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,000
The Destroyer of lives.

417
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,625
Ben Parker was as
devastated as I was.

418
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,000
From that moment,

419
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,875
we both knew that
with great power,

420
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:51,583
there must always come
great responsibility.

421
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,958
So that's how Uncle Ben
learned that lesson.

422
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,625
I gave my ring and
my costume to Ben

423
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,458
to keep hidden
somewhere in his house.

424
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,250
Hidden from me,

425
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,083
so that I'd never be
tempted to use them again.

426
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,083
But I also gave him my key
to the Doomsday device.

427
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,750
Fury knew about that.

428
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,708
When he heard May Parker
was selling the house,

429
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,375
he urged me to stop her.

430
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,125

telling me all this,

431
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,708

only take a second.

00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,208
Why do I do this?

440

you were a real superhero
in World War II,

451

but for the rest of your life
you've been a regular person.

miss the very air I breathe.

is a wonderful gift,
