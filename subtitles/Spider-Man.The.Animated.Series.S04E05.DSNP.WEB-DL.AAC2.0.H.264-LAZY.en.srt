00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,500
I chose to use a scorpion,

166
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,208
because it's a natural predator
of the spider.

167
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:32,708
[Jonah] Spider-Man will
at last meet his match.

168
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,333
There's only one reason
I bothered to save

169
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,750
your miserable life
after your lab went kablooey!

170
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,375
It's because I need
a science guy like you

171
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,583
to turn me back
to plain old Mac Gargan.

172
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:48,458
Fine, then let me go,
so I can cure us both!

173
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,708
[groaning]

174
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,375
You're gonna stay
right where you are

175
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,875
until I can get
the money to build us a lab.

176
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,875
Why don't you steal it,
bug boy?

177
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,208
Petty crime is your forte.

178
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,208
No! I told you,
I'm going straight!

179
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,291
[laughs] You're going
nowhere, Gargan.

180
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,875
You're hiding.

181
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:11,333
Maybe you should call
yourself "The Cockroach."

182
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,458
Nah, but maybe you
do have a point.

183
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,000
I gotta do something.

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,250
You're doing
the right thing, Gargan!

185
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,458
[Gargan] Sarah!
-Mac, what are you doing?!

186
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,166
You can't go out in public!

187
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,958
If they caught you,
they'd put you in jail.

188
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,625
I'd never see you again.

189
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,708
But, Sarah, honey,
don't you want me to be normal?

190
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,250
We'll get the money,
it'll be okay.

191
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,750
I've already saved $500.

192
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,833
Wow, 500 whole dollars!

193
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,708
By the time we have enough,

194
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,708
my young self
will look like I do now!

195
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,333
Don't you ever insult her again!

196
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,875
I'll do it your way.

197
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,125
Thank you, Mac.
We'll make it, I promise.

198
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,166
Then we can get married.

199
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,000
[Peter, thinking]
This is getting me nowhere.

200
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,833
There are no records
of either the Scorpion

201
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:01,208
or the Vulture being seen
since the lab explosion.

202
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,875
Only eight hours left.

203
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,750
Maybe I should keep
trying to find Smythe.

204
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,708
At least I know he's out there.

205
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,416
I never realized how much
the Black Cat meant to me,

206
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,458
until now.

207
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,500
[knock on door]

208
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,291
Pete, can I come in?

209
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,958
I don't mean
to bother you, but...

210
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,333
Well, I'm feeling
really down tonight.

211
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,458
I thought maybe we could talk?

212
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,250
Not now, Harry, I can't.

213
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,250
Look, Pete, this won't
take long, I just--

214
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,833
That's weird.

215
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,875
I'm sorry, Harry.

216
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,166
Sorry that Spider-Man always
gets in the way of my life.

217
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,708
And my friendships.

218
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,458
[Connors]
You want me to declare

219
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,583
that I've made
a new breakthrough

220
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,458
in the science of Neogenics?

221
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,416
Look, I know your new research
isn't that far along yet,

222
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,083
but I really need your help!

223
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:46,708
Well, I'm crazy for doing this,
but I do owe you.

224
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,708
[beeping]

225
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,458
J-3 Communications.

226
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,458
This is Dr. Curt Connors
of Empire State University.

227
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,583
I have a story for you.

228
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,708
Neogenics,
the technology to change

229
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,583
the genetic structure
of any living creature,

230
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,583
will be reborn again.

231
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,583
I have rediscovered
the secrets

232
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,583
that Farley Stillwell took
with him when he disappeared.

233
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,625
Hey, that's the stuff
I need to transform me!

234
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:15,375
I'm appealing to
any institution or individual

235
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,291
to help me
fund Neogenic research,

236
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,875
rebuild
the Neogenic recombinator,

237
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,833
and once again offer
the possibility

238
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,166
of a better life for everyone.

239
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,291
You're right, Toomes,
I gotta act now.

240
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:31,208
Well, you're finally using
more than your tail, bug boy!

241
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:35,000
Mac, darling, what's wrong?
Where are you going?

242
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,500
Mac, what are you doing?

243
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,708
I gotta get that money
the only way I know how.

244
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,875
I'm doing it for us!

245
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,708
-[Sarah] Mac! Mac!
-[doorknob rattling]

246
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,458
Don't hurt anyone!

247
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,250
All of you, keep away from me,
and nobody'll get hurt!

248
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,625
[Spider-Man] Took long enough
to smoke you out.

249
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,458
Looks like retirement
didn't mellow you any.

250
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,166
Beat it, you stinkin' yo-yo!

251
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,208
I don't have time
to joke around! [straining]

252
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,083
[groaning]

253
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,708
Scorpion,
you're gonna listen to me

254
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,000
if I have to tie you up
with your own tail!

255
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,833
All right, you want my tail,
Spider-Man?

256
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,833
Here, it's all yours!

257
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,125
Ooh! Aah!

258
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,750
I warned you to leave me alone.

259
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,125
Now it's too late for you.

260
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,375
[Spider-Man gasping]

261
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,000
Scorpion,
you've got to listen!

262
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,833
Hey, my money!

263
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,000
[grunts]

264
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,000
Get away from that money,
you hear me?

265
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,250
Get away from it!

266
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,708
Mac, what are you doing?!

267
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,875
Stupid wall-crawler!
You ruined everything!

268
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,083
-I'm running out of time!
-I'm running out of time, too!

269
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,333
Aaah!

270
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,875
-[crash]
-Ooh!

271
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,375
Smythe, I've got Scorpion.

272
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:09,958
Excellent, I shall send
a spider seeker to guide you in.

273
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,708
Tell Silvermane
that phase one is successful.

274
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,583
The Spider has caught his prey.

275
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,458
I can't wait to see the Cat.

276
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,708
-You could've been--
-We've got something special.

277
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,083
Can't you feel it?

278
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,291
I care about her
more than I even knew.

279
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,375
You understand, before I
consider our bargain complete,

280
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,166
I must make sure he's genuine.

281
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,833
His DNA patterns are excellent.

282
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,458
He's a Neogenic roadmap.

283
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:58,000
The perfect Rosetta Stone
for my little experiment.

284
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,875
Mac, no!

285
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,500
I kept my word, Smythe.

286
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,708
And I shall keep mine.
There she is.

287
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,416
Okay, release her.

288
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm saving
that privilege for you.

289
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,333
I don't suspect
there's any kind of trap here?

290
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,208
Don't be too upset
about this, Cat.

291
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,500
Sometimes in the superhero biz,
you make a few mistakes.

292
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,875
-Indeed.
-[spider-sense tingling]

293
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,958

superhero lessons

from the Hulk instead.

297
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,083
[Silvermane]
Good work, Smythe.

298
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,333
This is one bonus
of which I approve.

299
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,958
Thank you, Silvermane.

300
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:45,416
Did he say Silvermane?
Silvermane is alive?

301
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:51,458
Spider-Man, I shall make a trade
to swap your age for mine,

302
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:55,125
and with your powers,
I will be unbeatable!

303
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,625
-[giggling]
-Excellent idea, Father.

304
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,958
Silvermane is that baby?

305
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,083
So, here's another
fine mess we've gotten
ourselves into, Ollie.

306
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,000
Any bright ideas, partner?

307
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,708
Did I hear you say partner?

308
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,625
Please, you've got to save Mac!

309
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,500
Why should I?

310
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,583
They're going to Neogenic
him or something!

311
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,458
Neogenic? Are you certain?

312
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,375
Positive!

313
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:27,083
Just the sound of that word
makes me feel young again.

314
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:32,291
I guess I willcrash
your boyfriend's party!

315
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,208
[laughing]

316
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,416
I'll show you where to go.

317
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,166
[Smythe] Thanks to the DNA
from the Scorpion,

318
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,000
everything is ready.

319
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,625
Then do it now.
I want to be a man again!

320
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:51,000
Full of youth and superpower
of Spider-Man!

321
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,833
[Black Cat] What are
they doing to Spider-Man?
