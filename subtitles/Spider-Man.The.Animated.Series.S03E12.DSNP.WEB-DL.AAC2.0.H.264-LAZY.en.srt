00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,833
So I take it your
experiment was a success.

167
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,833
Uh, yes and no.

168
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,708
It has yet to be perfected.

169
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:22,000
I want that technology,
and I want it soon.

170
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,375
Do I make myself clear?

171
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,708
Crystal!
Safety first, though.

172
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,708
Wouldn't want to have
an arm lopped off

173
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,750
by an unstable portal, would we?

174
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,625
[laughs nervously]

175
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:37,583
[Kingpin] Do your work
and do it quickly.

176
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,000
Well, that went well.

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,125
Jonathan, you have to tell him.

178
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,083
What else can you do?

179
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,458
Plenty.
First, we must put this

180
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,625
where he can't get
his money-grubbing
little fingers on it.

181
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,875
Then we set up
a laboratory of our own.

182
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,000
All we need is a little capital.

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,708
And that's no problem.

184
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,750
Not for, ta-da, The Spot!

185
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,458
[Peter] What did you
find out, Dr. Connors?

186
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,083
Your hunch was correct.

187
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,708
Those spots were actually
time dilation portals

188
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,166
similar to the ones
Stark created.

189
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,750
They share some properties
with black holes.

190
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,333
They absorb radio waves,
for example,

191
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,708
but they lack the super gravity
of their big brothers.

192
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,708
Stark has issued
a public statement

193
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,458
saying he's not to blame.

194
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,458
It's a fascinating puzzle.

195
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,375
[thinking]
Fascinating and deadly.

196
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,416
Maybe what Doc Connors
said about radio waves
being absorbed

197
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,291
could be the answer
I'm looking for.

198
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,416
Hey, MJ, Liz!
Wait up!

199
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,875
Mary Jane, let me explain.

200
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,708
Liz, you may tell Mr. Parker

201
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,291
that I think he should
permanently disappear,

202
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,000
because we don't have
anything left to talk about.

203
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,833
Peter, Mary Jane says--

204
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,708
I heard. MJ, please.

205
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,000
Mary Jane!

206
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,875
Happy to see me, friend?

207
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,708
-Harry?
-Oh, you do remember.

208
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,333
I thought you might have
put me out of your mind

209
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,625
when you stole MJ away from me!

210
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,333
Thanks a lot, pal!

211
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,708
Listen, Harry, I-- Listen!

212
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,000
This is just not my day.

213
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
[sighs]

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,416
[portal rumbling]

215
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,208
Maybe Spider-Man
will have better luck.

216
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,083
-[alarm bell ringing]
-[spider-sense tingling]

217
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,708
A bank robbery?
On Sunday afternoon?

218
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,750
What kind of nut would break
into a bank in broad daylight?

219
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,208
Oh, that kind of nut.

220
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,583
How the heck did
he get in there?

221
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,750
Shouldn't you be the mascot
at a fire station or something?

222
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,875
Whoa! Ooh!

223
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,250
[The Spot]
Did that hurt?

224
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,083
Sorry, I'm
in something of a hurry.

225
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,583
Bit of a goof,
setting off those alarms, eh?

226
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,250
Uh, yeah.

227
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,000
Say, I hate to interrupt,

228
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,875
but are you planning on stealing

229
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,125
that really big pile
of money there?

230
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,833
Uh, yes, rather.

231
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:52,875
And how exactly
were you planning

232
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,708
on doing that, Mister, uh...

233
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,625
Call me The Spot.

234
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,125
And I was planning
on doing this!

235
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,458
You're the wacko behind
those time dilation portals.

236
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,625
There's no need for all this.

237
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,166
I'm not a criminal.

238
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,291
I just need a little capital
for my research!

239
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,291
Those portals
are too dangerous!

240
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,000
You've got to stop using them!

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,291
Nonsense!

242
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,333
Oh, boy. Not this again.

243
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,708
Forgive me.

244
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,750
I usually abhor violence.

245
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,083
Oh, puh-lease!

246
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,333
Well, that does look
like a sticky situation.

247
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,291
Let me give you a hand,
or, actually, a foot.

248
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,250
Gotcha!

249
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,333
There.

250
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,416
Even though this guy
is trouble,

251
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,083
I'm gonna have a hard time
taking him seriously.

252
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,750
But he is serious.

253
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,583
A scientist, in fact.

254
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,708
It's time I started thinking
like a scientist, too.

255
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:06,458
If I adapt my tracker to
broadcast at radio frequencies

256
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,333
and zero in on wherever there
are gaps in the wave pattern,

257
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,416
any gaps would
indicate a portal.

258
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:15,208
And wherever there's a portal,
The Spot won't be far away.

259
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,333
[Felicia] What are
we doing here, Jason?

260
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,750
I have to do a little shopping.

261
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,333
Oh, my.

262
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,291
It's beautiful.

263
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,833
It's for you.

264
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,958
Felicia, will you marry me?

265
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,458
Oh, Jason.

266
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,750
Oh, you're so sweet.

267
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,625
It's just that I--

268
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,458
[The Spot]
What a beautiful store.

269
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,000
Nice setting for a robbery.

270
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,458
Now, let's get down to business.

271
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,416
-[tracker beeping]
-A distortion.

272
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,125
Right here!

273
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,458
Oh, Miss!

274
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,750
I know this seems
frightfully rude,

275
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,875
but, the fact is, your ring
looks very expensive and--

276
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,416
Get away from her, freak!

277
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,583
It appears you need
a lesson in manners.

278
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,708
You're the one
who needs a lesson.

279
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:10,750
Spider-Man!

280
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,166
[The Spot] What are you,
some kind of masochist?

281
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,458
Maybe I need spot remover.

282
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,333
-Are you hurt?
-Felicia?

283
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,583
No, I'm okay, but I've got
to go after that creep.

284
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,500
-Spider-Man, wait!
-What is it?

285
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,708
I haven't seen you in weeks.

286
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,000
Are you avoiding me?

287
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,458
Avoiding you?

288
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,208
Look, Felicia, I thought
I'd made this clear.

289
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,458
We can't let there
be anything between us.

290
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,583
My life is just too dangerous,

291
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,750
and I care too much for you
to jeopardize yours.

292
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,583
I'm sorry.

293
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,583
So am I.

294
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,333
Sylvia, I'm back!

295
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Sylvia?

296
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,875
[Kingpin] And you say Dr.Ohn
controls this power at will?

297
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,208
[Sylvia]
Yes, he needs no machine.

298
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,000
Fascinating.

299
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,083
We must find a way to duplicate
his powers in others.

300
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,125
Understood, Kingpin.

301
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,250
-[Ohn] No.
-Jonathan?

302
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,708
You've betrayed me to Fisk.

303
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,458
Why?

304
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,208
He's a powerful crime lord
known as the Kingpin.

305
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,208
He owns me, Jonathan.

306
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,583
I care for you too much

307
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,416
to watch you try
to take him on and fail.

308
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,250
But, Sylvia,
don't you understand?

309
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,958
I can take him on!

310
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,125
I won't fail!

311
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,208
Mr. Fisk, I'm here to terminate
our contracts with you.

312
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,375
[guns cocking]

313
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,250
You were saying?

314
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,583
Your stooges are
nothing to me, Fisk!

315
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,708
You have no power!

316
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,416
I am the new Kingpin.

317
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,333
I very much doubt that, Ohn.

318
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:01,583
The Kingpin always holds
the trump card.

319
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,000
Sylvia!

320
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,125
[Kingpin]
You will do exactly as I say.

321
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,708
I don't think I have to tell you

322
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,625
what happens to her if you fail.

323
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,958
Ohh.

324
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,583
-Another time dilation hole.
-[beeping]

325
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,875
It's got to be Ohn!

326
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,708
Bingo!

327
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:25,875
