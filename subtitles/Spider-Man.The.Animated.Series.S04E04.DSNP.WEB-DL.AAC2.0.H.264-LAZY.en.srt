-He got away because of you!
-[meows]

169
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,000
What were you thinking?

170
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,500
You risked both
our lives for this?

171
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,708
I couldn't let an innocent
creature be destroyed.

172
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,458
Don't you care
about anybody anymore?

173
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,208
That's just the problem.
I don't think I do.

174
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,833
Wait.

175
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,875
I don't know why you wanna
be a crime fighter.

176
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:39,250
Take my advice. In the end,
you'll regret it big time.

177
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,958
I wish I could tell him
why I wanna be a crime fighter.

178
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,375
It's not just for me,

179
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,875
but for my father as well.

180
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,458
I wanted something
better for you.

181
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,333
Better than the life I had.

182
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,416
Daddy, this isn't your fault.

183
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,958
There was no way
you could've stopped

184
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,208
the Kingpin
from giving me that serum.

185
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,833
Maybe.
But what about all the times

186
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,000
you needed me
when you were growing up,

187
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,458
and I wasn't there?

188
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,125
Will you ever
forgive me for that?

189
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,375
That's all in the past.

190
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,333
I wanna make up
for all the mistakes

191
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,708
he made in his life.

192
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,458
That's what he'd want me to do.

193
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,583
But Spider's become
so hard-hearted lately.

194
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,583
How can I make him understand

195
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,375
what a great companion
a cat can be?

196
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,583
I should feel
badly about this.

197
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,583
After all, Kraven did
save my life once.

198
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,625
Now I'm trying to bring him in.

199
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,875
Why am I always hurting people?

200
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,583
Especially
once this mask is on?

201
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,083
And I wonder how Aunt May's
doing with Anna Watson.

202
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,583
Maybe I ought to peek in
to make sure everything's okay.

203
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,166
Hey, who's that guy
watching the house?

204
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,333
It's Harry Osborn.

205
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,458
Looks like he's taking
Mary Jane's disappearance

206
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,125
as hard as I am.

207
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,291
I should talk to him.

208
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,708
But I have nothing to offer.

209
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,583
The Black Cat was right.

210
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,250
I feel nothing in my heart
right now for others.

211
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,416
And that makes me
a worse monster than Kraven.

Aaah!

00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,500
That's interesting.

Uh-uh! Whoa!

Oh! Flash!

223
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,708
This would be much easier
if you would hold still.

224
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,208
Debra, I never
did anything like this

225
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,000
for any of my other dates.

226
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Not even Felicia Hardy.

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,583
Hmm. I'll consider myself
a member of an elite society

228
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,000
from here on in.

229
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,291
Yes! Claw marks.

230
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,250
And a hair sample.

231
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,083
This supports my theory

232
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,583
that the night stalker
is some strange animal.

233
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,583
Phase one of my investigation
is complete.

234
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,458
Now phase two.

235
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,083
Phase two?

236
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,291
All right, Spidey.
You've faced this puzzle before.

237
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,333
How do you hunt for the hunter

238
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,875
in an asphalt jungle
as big as New York?

239
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,750
The last time,
I tracked him down

240
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,166
to the special jungle exhibit
at the Central Park Zoo.

241
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,458
He's at home
in that kind of environment.

242
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,208
-It's where
he has an advantage.
-[growling]

243
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,875
I'll start there.

244
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,250
I just wish I knew
what he's after.

245
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,833
Okay, the coast is clear.

246
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,166
Debra, what are we doing here?

247
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,583
Listen, Flash, this was where
that creature was spotted last.

248
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:36,000
If I can prove its existence,
maybe I can get funding

249
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,375
for another project
I've been wanting to do.

250
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:41,000
-Project? What project?
-[growling]

251
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,875
Shh!
I thought I heard something.

252
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,458
Wait a minute.

253
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,083
I just figured it out.

254
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,458
Figured what out?

255
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,166
You've been
into this weirdo stuff

256
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,000
ever since Michael Morbius
disappeared.

257
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,208
You think that this might lead
to Morbius, don't you?

258
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,083
That's your project, isn't it?

259
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,291
You don't know
what you're talking about.

260
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,750
[Flash] Well, you wanna
find that vampire?

261
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,833

to leave me alone Spider-Man!

00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:33,250
Oh, no.
Not more jungle dust.

275
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,958
[gasps]
Can't see straight.

There's nothing
that beast can dish out

that this beauty can't handle.

Why do you stalk this city?

This hunt is not my passion!

292
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,833
It is my tragedy!

Great! Just great!

294
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,958
Don't worry, Spider.
I'll help you find him.

295
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,291
I don't need your help.

296
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,458
I need you to stay
out of my way.

297
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,708
Out of my life!

298
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,333
[Debra] What's with him?

299
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,291
I don't know.
He seems to be going through

300
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,625
some personal struggle
right now.

301
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,208
Unfortunately,
it's giving him tunnel vision.

302
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,250
I mean,
there's more involved here

303
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,333
than what Spider thinks.

304
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:53,166
For instance, why did Kraven
call his hunt a tragedy?

305
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,875
And you two.
What are you doing here?

306
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,000
We're not doing anything
that I wouldn't drop

307
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,250
in a hot New York minute
if you needed me.

308
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,833
In fact, if Spider-Man
doesn't wanna be your partner,

309
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,583
I'm willing to--
[Flash grunts]

310
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,833
Ahem! I have a scientific
interest in the stalker.

311
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,416
So I tracked him down
to his lair

312
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,750
here in the park.

313
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,750
Really?

314
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,000
Perhaps we need to talk.

315
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,958
Is Kraven
and this ferocious stalker

316
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,083
one in the same?

317
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,583
But if so, how does
he transform himself and why?

318
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,708
Was it a nasty aftereffect
of his taking the serum?

319
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,875
I've gotta figure out
where he'll strike next.

320
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,416
Now that Central Park
isn't his lair any longer,

321
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,291
does East River Park seem
like the next best location?

322
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,958
I couldn't see it clearly.

323
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,875
It was some kind
of horrible monster.

324
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,875
It headed east out of the park.

325
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,375
Well, I had the right park,
but I'm too late.

326
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,000
Kraven's on the move again.

327
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,875
The Williamsburg Bridge
