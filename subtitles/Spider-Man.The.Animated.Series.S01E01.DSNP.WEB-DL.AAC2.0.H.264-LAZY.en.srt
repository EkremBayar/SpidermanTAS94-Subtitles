00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,875
[sighs] You were downright
brave back there.

167
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,166
It was quiet a surprise.

168
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:33,125
Why, Ms. Whitman, is that
a compliment, from you?

169
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,583
Don't push your luck, Peter.

170
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,833
What was that thing?

171
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,375
And why would it
kidnap Dr. Connors?

172
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,375
[Peter] Dr. Connors,
I'm ready to proceed.

173
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,500
Temperature Alpha,
respiration alpha,

174
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,250
life signs all register
normal, Dr. Connors.

175
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,833
If I'm right, Mickey here
is better than normal.

176
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:15,000
Look, look, there it is.

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,083
A reptiles ability to grow
a new limb in a mammal.

178
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,250
Because of a couple
of micrograms

179
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,708
of reptile DNA and the
Neogenic Recombinator.

180
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,166
Incredible.

181
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,583
No, Peter, this is
just the beginning.

182
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,583
When we do the same
for human beings,

183
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,458
when we can replace
limbs lost in accidents

184
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,458
or during a war,
that will be incredible.

185
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,750
Why would anybody want to
kidnap Doc Connors?

186
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,083

Mommy, is Daddy coming home?

I don't know, Billy. I...

[screams]

191
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,583
Stay away, leave us alone.

192
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,500
Easy, Mrs. Connors.

193
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,875
I'm looking for the Professor.

194
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,250
No, I won't let you
hurt my husband.

195
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,000
-Hurt him, I...
-No!

Just hold that pose, Smiley.

Great, there goes my
thousand dollar photo.

204
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,875
Well, when am I gonna get the
hang of being a superhero

205
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,875
and a photographer
at the same time.

[growling]

209
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,875
Now that you've crawled
out of your sewer,

210
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,750
maybe you'd better
stick around.

211
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,875
Cause I wanna know what
you did with Doc Connors.

Did I hear right?

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,083
Did he say "Daddy"?

224
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,083
Yes, yes, that was Curt.

225
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,333
It all started with a device.

226
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,458
[thunder rumbles]

227
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,083
[woman] Curt called it the
Neogenic Recombinator.

228
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,708
He used it on himself,

229
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,708
as an experiment to
make his arm grow again.

230
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:06,375
But it turned him into
that, that creature.

231
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,958
Why haven't you told
anybody, the police?

232
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,583
No, they'll think
he's a freak.

233
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:16,208
They'll hunt him down
and hurt him, or worse.

234
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,625
[sighs] I know how that goes.

235
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,375
But not if I can
reach him first.

236
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,583
I'm so scared.

237
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,375
We'll keep this quiet.

it'll be Pulitzer time.

Hang loose, Brock.

That webbing will melt
in a couple of hours.

244

You can't do this.

245
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,583
I already have, I won't
let you ruin Connors' life.

Billy, where's your mom?

250
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:53,708
Daddy came back and took
her away, down there.

251
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,750
The sewers.

252

Listen, I'm gonna carry
you to a neighbor's house,

where you'll be safe.

Then I'll go get your mom
and your dad too, okay.

Okay, don't let
anything happen to them.

Ugh, what a slimy mess.

Why can't I be one of those
galaxy hopping superheroes?

259
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,625
Why do I end up in the sewers?

Yuck, ugh.

[gasping and spitting]

262
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,125
You don't find
The Fantastic Four in a sewer,

263
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,625
or the Avengers.

264
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,250
Never have I seen the Avengers
in a sewer.

265
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,458
Or The Defenders.
Well, maybe The Hulk.

Quit grinding, Parker, you know
what's really bothering you.

You're scared.

268
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,166
This lizard creature's
powerful enough

269
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,750
to tear you limb from limb.

270
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,291
But you can't even hurt him.

271
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,458
Because trapped
inside is your friend.

272
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,000
But I have to fight him,

273
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,208
it's the only way to
stop him, to save him.

Well, isn't this
the story of my life.

Stop, no, don't.

00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,750
Got to reach her fast.

278
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,583
Whoa, not this fast.

279
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,291
Uh oh. [indistinct]

280
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,083
Time to put on the brakes.

[grunts and groans]

282
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,708
My webbing's losing
its consistency,

283
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,833
I better change
cartridges soon.

284
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,500
Worst part of all this is,

285
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,583
I was the one who helped the
Doc with his experiments.

286
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,958
If it wasn't for me... huh?

287
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,458
Save me.

288
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,583
Save me.

289
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,708
The missing subway worker.

290
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,625
Was building some
electrical thing,

291
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,416
couldn't do it himself,
needed my help.

292
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,833
But I got weak.

293
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,458
No food, no sleep.

294
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,708
-[sighs]
-[woman yelling]

295
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,583
You'll come back for me, right?

296
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,875
Hey, I'm a hero, remember?

297
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:16,291
Why did you bring
me here, Curt, why?

298
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,875
So we could be together.

299
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,750
You're still my husband.

300
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,333
I love you.

301
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,416
I want to be with you,
but not like this.

302
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,500
I love you too.

303
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,416
I need you, and I
needed your help.

304
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,583
With this.

305
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,000
I need your hands to
operate it for me.

306
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:40,958
Mine can't grasp like other
humans with scales.

307
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,958
Wh--What are you going
to do with that?

308
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,000
Don't be afraid, Margaret,
it'll transform you.

309
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You'll be able to heal
any wound,

310
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,125
replace any limb.

311
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,083
First you, then everyone.

312
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,583
Once I connect the
Neogenic Recombinator

313
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,583
to these electrical conduits,

314
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,375
I can reach every
home in the city.

315
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,833
Every man, woman, and child.

316
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,000
I can transform all of them.

317
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,166
No more suffering,
no more pain.

318
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:13,416
But, Curt, after you
transform everyone,

319
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,958
we'll all be like you.

320
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,458
-Of course.
-I'm the first of a new race.

321
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,083
A better race.

322
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,583
If you're so much better,

323
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,500
why do you need
my hands to help you?

324
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,583
You're not better,
look what you've become.

325
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:30,125
No, you're twisting things.

326
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,750
I can make people well again.

327
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,375
And I won't stop for anything.

328
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,583
Not even for Billy?

329
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,291
You want him to
be like you too?

330
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,291
My son, I have a son.

331
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,875
Sorry, Doc,
I'm doing this for Billy

332
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,125
as much as for you.

333
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,458

334
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,458

[growls]

336
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,625
His mind's all reptile now.

337
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,583
[growls]

338
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,375
Mrs. Connor,
get away while you can.

339
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,875
He's dangerous.

340
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,708
No, don't touch that thing.

341
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,583
Mrs. Connors, run!

342
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:27,708
[screams]

343
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,000
Oh, no.

344
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:39,416
Margaret, I'm sorry.

345
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,458
One chance at this,
or I'm lizard food.

346
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,583
Oh-oh, chow time.

347
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:53,958
Curt.

348
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,625
[Spider-Man]
Strange, so strange.

349
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:01,000
A week ago this creature
was a scientist,

350
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,500
my teacher, my friend.

351
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,708
He cared for me and wanted
to help me, just as I do.

352
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,083
And now look at
the both of us,

353
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,500
fighting each other.

354
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,333
Fighting for our lives.

355
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,333
Curt, Spider-Man.

356
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,708
[electric surging]

357
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,166
[gasp]

358
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,583
Curt.

359
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,250
Is he...

360
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,458
He'll be okay.

361
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,875
Oh, thank heavens.

362
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,708
I'll help you carry
him out of here in a second.

363
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,583
But first, I have
to get something.

364
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:03,458
A thousand dollar
photo, not too shabby.

365
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,208
And what's Eddy Brock
going to end up with,

366
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,458
an exclusive story nobody's
ever going to believe.

367
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,750
I tell you, JJ,
The Lizard is Curt Connors.

368
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,583
I woulda had you
out here earlier

369
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,375
but Spider-Man webbed me.

370
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,333
Dr. Connors is a
respected scientist, Brock.

371
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,875
-[car door closes]
-And Peter Parker already
brought me photos

372
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,625
of The Lizard
earlier this morning.

373
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,833
But I'll show you
The Lizard himself.

374
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,708
You better be right
about this.

375
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:29,625
Boss, if I'm wrong, I'll eat
today's issue of The Bugle.

376
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,500
J. Jonah Jameson, what
brings you here this morning?

377
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,375
[gasp]

378
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,458
You want it cooked or raw?

379
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,750
Peter,
where did you get this?

380
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,000
I sold an exclusive
photo to the Daily Bugle.

381
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,708
- Oh, dear.
- What's wrong?

382
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,750
Exactly how did you happen
to get this picture?

383
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,375
Well, I um...

384
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,708
- No hemming and hawing.
- Aunt May, I...

385
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,875
You followed Spider-Man
into the sewer, didn't you?

386
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:02,708
Uh, yeah, right.

387
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,708
It's cold and damp down there.

388
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:09,583
You probably got germs
incubating even as we speak.

389
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,833
You need some hot soup
and a good long rest.

390
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:17,000
A nice boy like you taking
pictures in a sewer.

391
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,500
And what if that horrible
Spider-Man had caught you?

392
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,875
[Peter] Aunt May, she'd
never understand.

393
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,250
Spider-Man's already
caught me in his web.

394
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,875
And for better or worse,

395
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,000
he and I are stuck
together, forever.
