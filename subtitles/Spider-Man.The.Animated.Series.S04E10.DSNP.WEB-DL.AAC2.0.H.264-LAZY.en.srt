00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:02,875
why do we not destroy
the useless human female now?

168
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,250
Because Gila has a soft spot
in her heart for humans.

169
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,416
No, Monitor, unlike you,
I think all living creatures

170
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,583
should be treated with respect.

171
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,375
[chuckles]
An amusing concept.

172
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,208
We are stronger than all humans,

173
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,500
therefore we should
be their leaders.

174
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,250
[Gila]
Our father disagrees.

175
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,208
We must follow his will.

176
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,458
If he is really our father.

177
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,458
Who are you?

178
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,458
What do you want from us?

179
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,500
All your questions will
be answered soon, Father.

180
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Why do you think Dr. Connors
is your father?

181
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,291
It is in our blood.
We can feel it.

182
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,458
You see, once, we crawled
on our bellies in the dark.

183
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,083
No past, no future.

184
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,583
Then something happened.

185
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,750
We began to grow,
to think with the knowledge

186
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,583
of the father
who gave us his blood.

187
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,208
We share it.

188
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:56,416
That is how we know
he is our father.

189
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,000
You gave us life, Father.

190
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,750
Now you must fulfill
your destiny, and ours.

191
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,416
What destiny?

192
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,375
[Gila]
To lead us into the future.

193
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,583
To tell us our true purpose.

194
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,208
They're as crazy
as they are ugly.

195
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,708
You didn't create them.

196
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,333
I don't think
it's as simple as that.

197
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,958
In my impatience to make
a scientific breakthrough

198
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,583
and re-grow my arm,
I combined my own DNA

199
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,875
with the DNA of a lizard.

200
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,458
In doing so,
I turned myself into a monster.

201
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,875
In seeking
a more permanent solution,

202
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:34,166
I began experimenting with
my own mutated body chemistry.

203
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,250
The experiment failed.
I was furious!

204
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,416
If I'd been thinking clearly,
I never would have

205
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,583
let the fluid
go down the drain.

206
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,083
That fluid must have
been what they drank.

207
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:47,833
They will learn that their
existence is a pure accident,

208
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,625
and I can't lead them anywhere.

209
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,708
They will not be pleased.

210
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,208
Dr. Connors, your arm!

211
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:58,583
-[growling]
-Monitor, look!

212
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,416
Run, Mary Jane,
before it's too late!

213
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,333
Tell my wife and son,

214
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,333
tell them I love them!

215
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,583
Ohh!

216
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,083
-[screams]
-Whoa, MJ, it's me.

217
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,458
Peter!

218
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,291
Oh, wake me up.

219
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,500
Tell me this is a nightmare.

220
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,333
Don't worry, I'm here now,

221
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,875
and everything will be okay.

222
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,875
Dr. Connors claims
it-- it was all a result

223
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,250
of that accident
he told me about.

224
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,125
I was afraid Neogenics
was at the bottom of this.

225
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,708
Look, MJ, follow this tunnel
back a short distance.

226
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,291
You'll get out of here safely.

227
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,875
-What about you?
-I've gotta find Doc Connors.

228
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,958
You have to let
somebody else go.

229
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,875
No, I have to go.

230
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,458
This is what I do to make
a difference in the world.

231
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,708
Is this the way
it's always going to be then?

232
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,000
You risk your life
against insane odds

233
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
while I sit back and worry?

234
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,333
I'm sorry, I have no choice.

235
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,416
If you think I'm just going
to wait, Peter Parker,

236
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,000
you don't know me at all.

237
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,125
[growling, hissing,
and shouting]

238
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,625
-Hold him!
-Hold him!

239
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,500
Don't worry, Doc,
the cavalry's here!

240
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,958
You've got to hold off
that transformation.

241
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,708
-[groaning]
-Try!

242
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,625
-[screaming]
-I don't like the sound of that.

243
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,583
[lizards growling]

244
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,375
I like the sound
of that even less.

245
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,583
Come on Doc,
let's get out of here

246
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,375
before the party
gets too crowded.

247
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,583
No, Father, don't leave us!

248
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,583
[doorbell rings]

249
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,500
Mary Jane,
what are you doing here?

250
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,083
It-- It's your husband.

251
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,708
Curt?
What's happened?

252
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,416
There was this experiment,
and he...

253
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,125
He's turning into--

254
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,125
The lizard?

255
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,125
You know?

256
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,875
Come inside, quickly.

257
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,416
Curt said I should
watch this tape

258
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,958
if anything happened to him.

259
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,333
He left specific instructions.

260
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,708
Margaret,
if you're playing this,

261
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:48,291
then all my attempts to control
the lizard have failed.

262
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,875
You must now take extreme
measures, my darling.

263
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:54,583
First, take Billy to stay
with your sister, and then,

264
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:58,875
in the safe, you will find
a kind of genetic neutron bomb,

265
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,875
harmless to all life

266
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:04,375
except that which has been
mutated by Neogenics.

267
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,000
I know this is hard for you,
Margaret,

268
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,125
but you must use this on me.

269
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,333
You must destroy the lizard.

270
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,333
Are you really going
to destroy your own husband?

271
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,875
No, but he's right.

272
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,000
I must destroy the lizard.

273
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,875
We need someone familiar
with Neogenics to help us.

274
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,291
We need Peter Parker.

275
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,958
Uh, Margaret,
Peter's out of town,

276
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,875
on assignment
for The Daily Bugle, I think.

277
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,583
Oh, dear.

278
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,375
But he's always told me
that Debra Whitman

279
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,750
was smarter than he is
any day of the week.

280
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,500
Debra, of course!

281
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,875
This way.

282
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,333
I sense the blood.

283
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,000
And soon
it will stain the ground.

284
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,583
Monitor, that's our father
you're talking about!

285
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,500
That remains to be proven!

286
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,125
Eeny-meeny-miny-mo.

287
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,166
This way.

288
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,250
How can you be sure?

289
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,291
Stick with me, Doc.

290
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,166
I make these kind
of executive-type decisions
all the time.

291
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,708
Uh-oh, visitors!

292
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,708
Well, the gang's all here.

293
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,291
Let the party begin.

294
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,458
[groaning]

295
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,291
Father, we don't
want to hurt you.

296
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,000
Speak for yourself, Gila.

297
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,500
[growling]

298
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,708
[roaring]

299
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,125
Connors! No!

300
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:19,125
Ha ha!

301
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,708
Oh, please, not this!
Not now!

302
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,833
[growling]

303
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,958
No!
This is not the way!

304
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:38,250
Yes, it's all clear to me now.

305
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,458
I am your father.

306
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,583
I once thought
that it was my lot in life

307
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,875
to improve the human condition,

308
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,583
but I was rejected
by the humans, defeated!

309
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,416
[growling]

310
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,000
Debra! Are you all right?

311
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,083
I got the wind
knocked out of me.

312
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,708
Doc Connors, come back!

313
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,083
-[explosion]
-[Debra] Peter!

314
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,000

[gasping]

317
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:18,708
Curt.

318
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,375
Is he... ?

319
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,708
He'll be okay.

320
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,833
Oh, thank heaven!

321
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,750
I was nearly destroyed by him!

322
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,083
The humans
cannot be reasoned with,

323
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,750
and they will
not let us coexist with them.

324
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,875
They must be destroyed!

325
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,166
[Gila] No!

326
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,416
We cannot act like savages.

327
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,708
Our father has spoken.

328
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,625
Doc Connors!

this device is intended
