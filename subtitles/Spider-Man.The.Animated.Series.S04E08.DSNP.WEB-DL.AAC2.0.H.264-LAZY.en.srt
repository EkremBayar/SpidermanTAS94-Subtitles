00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:48,166
Harry Osborn, son of the
industrialist, Norman Osborn,

168
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,458
who vanished four months ago.

169
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,166
Right on track, Chip.

170
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,458
Where there's Peter Parker,
there's trouble.

171
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,500
[newscaster] The criminal,
known as the Green Goblin,

172
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,000
was reported to be in the area

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,583
shortly
after the conflagration.

174
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,125
Frank, somebody must
have wanted to get

175
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,250
that Osborn kid real bad.

176
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,416
Yeah, but if he's still alive
then I want to find him.

177
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:09,083
Maybe he'll tell me
what he knows about Parker.

178
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,000
[Chip] I've got
an alternate address on Osborn.

179
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,583
Let's have it.

180
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,833
[horn blows]

181
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,750
I think I'll do this
as plain old Peter Parker.

182
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,708
The Osborn Estate guards
know me as Harry's best friend.

183
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,750
If they spot me inside, I'll
just say I'm looking for him,

184
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,208
which I am, sort of.

185
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,875
Okay, Harry, where are you?

186
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,166
What's this?

187
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,125
Well, well.

188
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,958
Harry's clothes
and his laptop in sleep mode.

189
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,500
He must have thought
it was off.

190
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,375
Nice.

191
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,708
Addresses for half a dozen
Goblin hideouts

192
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,583
across the city.

193
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,458
Norman set himself up
to be a one-goblin crime wave,

194
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,583
and now his son's
inherited the arsenal.

195
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,625
Lucky for me, Harry's a novice.

196
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,458
This list will lead me
right to him.

197
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,000
-Time to change back into--
-[spider-sense tingling]

198
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,833
Maybe not.

199
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,583
My spider-sense tells me
I'm being watched.

200
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,416
[Frank] You got a positive I.D.
on this guy, Chip?

201
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,083
Just like you thought, Frank.
It's Peter Parker.

202
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,583
Perfect. I'll keep on his tail
and see what he's up to.

203
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,458
I wish I knew
who was watching me

204
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,000
and where they are.

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,875
But I can't let
them slow me down.

206
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,375
There's too much at stake.

207
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,208
Well, this place is
on the Goblin's list,

208
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,833
but it doesn't get
the Good Housekeeping

209
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,583
Seal of Approval.

210
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,583
Ah, very clever, Norman.

211
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,458
[blows]

212
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,875
Okay, kid,
turn around real slow.

213
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,125
The Punisher, but why?

214
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,875
I'm looking
for Mary Jane Watson.

215
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,250
-You are?
-Yeah.

216
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,125
And three names keep coming up.

217
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:09,708
The Green Goblin,
Spider-Man, and Peter Parker.

218
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,583
So tell me,
what's the connection?

219
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,583
-Great.
-Talk to me, Parker.

220
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,208
I have only one thing to say--

221
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,708
trick or treat!

222
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,833
Come on, spider strength,
don't let me pass out.

223
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,416
Okay, smart boy.

224
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,000
Now you're gonna
tell me everything,

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,750
about Mary Jane Watson,

226
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,583
about Harry Osborn,
and about the secret identity

227
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,750
you've been hiding
from the world.

228
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,416
I think I know who you
really are, Peter Parker.

229
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,458
[dramatic beat]

230
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,250
The way I figure it, Parker,
you're really the Green Goblin.

231
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,500
What? That tranquilizer must
have gone to your head, too.

232
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
You took all these pictures
for The Bugle.

233
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,750
You're obviously
obsessed with Spider-Man,

234
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,125
and I'm told you're in love
with Mary Jane, too.

235
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,708
When she decided
she liked Harry better,

236
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:02,000
your mind snapped and you became
this Green Goblin character,

237
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,250
and you kidnapped her.

238
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,291
Brilliant deduction, Holmes.

239
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,000
But absolutely wrong.

240
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,875
[groans]

241
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,375
Goblin gloves!
Hope I can make 'em work.

242
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,833
I'm not here to play games, boy.

243
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,583
That's too bad.

244
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,000
Love to stick around for
the rest of your babble, but--

245
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,500
[groaning]

246
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,208
Now, if I could just
get this thing to start.

247
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,583
Whoa!

248
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,958
[laser blasts]

249
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,833
No wonder Norman went crazy!

250
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,125
Trying to steer this thing
would make anyone nuts!

251
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:37,458
Battle Van, stinger missile,
hone in on heat signature.

252
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,458
Fire.

253
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Great!

254
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,250
[helicopter buzzing]

255
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,250
No!

256
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,458
Come on, up, up!

257
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,500
Whoa!

258
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,166
Uh-oh.

259
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,583
[groaning]

260
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,583
Now that I've seen how agile
you can be on that thing,

261
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,083
I know I'm right.

262
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,458
What's this, Parker?

263
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,583
[explosion]

264
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,583
What the devil?

265
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,750
[cackling]

266
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,708
Well, what do you know.

267
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,458
That must be me up there!

268
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,333
[laser zaps]

269
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,000
Harry's too high.

270
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,166
But I've got to reach him
before the Punisher does.

271
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,500
And he will try to get to him

272
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,875
because he's got the disk now.

273
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,833
[sighing] At least
I still have the printout.

274
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,000
But which one do I go to first?

275
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,625
You reading this, Chip?

276
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,458
It's from the disk
I took off Parker.

277
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,958
[Chip] Looks like
a complete list

278
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,416
of Goblin hideouts
across the city.

279
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,458
Parker's tied
into this some way.

280
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,291
How?

281
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,333
Chip, can you plot me
the most expedient course

282
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,875
to all these locations?

283
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,583
[Chip] Already on it, Frank.

284
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,958
[dramatic music]

285
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,583
You allowed yourself
to be chased across the city

286
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,333
like some stray dog?

287
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,458
While I'm trapped
in another dimension,

288
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,083
you're out there
ruining my reputation.

289
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,875
I'm not you!

290
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,000
Can't you get that
through your head?!

291
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,208
Ah, you have a temper.

292
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,958
I like it.

293
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,458
It looks like there's a little
of the old Goblin spirit

294
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,833
in you after all.

295
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,458
Maybe more than you realize.

296
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,625
Now, go to Oscorp.

297
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,291
There you'll find a new battle
glider your father built.

298
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,958
With it,
you can defeat Spider-Man

299
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,500
and that gun-crazy goon.

300
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,708
Then you'll tell me
where my father is?

301
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,583
Yes, yes,
just as I promised you.

302
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,875
But I want Spider-Man
destroyed first.

303
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,708
Now, go, go, go go!

304
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:01,875
[bang]

305
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,833
-[tracker clinks]
-[cackling]

306
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,833
Why am I letting the Punisher
beat me to the punch?

307
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,958
All he did was run down
the list of Goblin hideouts.

308
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,500
I have the benefit
of knowing

309
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
that the new Green Goblin
is Harry.

310
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,291
And like any good Osborn,
ultimately he'll end up

311
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,500
at his home away from home--

312
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,333
Oscorp.

313
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,875
[Green Goblin] The computer
sequencer will load

314
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,708
the battle parts automatically.

315
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:33,166
With this glider,
you will soon be invincible!

316
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,958
I don't care
about invincibility.

317
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,833
I just want to see
my father again.

318
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,208
[Spider-Man] I'm sorry, Harry,

319
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,458
but your father is gone.

320
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,875
Why are you doing this?

321
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,708
This isn't like you.

322
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,875
Don't listen to Parker!
He pretended to be your friend,

323
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,833
but he really wanted
to hurt you all along.

324
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,083
Yes, yes.

325
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,000
You betrayed me before Peter!

326
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,458
You stole Mary Jane away!

327
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,875
