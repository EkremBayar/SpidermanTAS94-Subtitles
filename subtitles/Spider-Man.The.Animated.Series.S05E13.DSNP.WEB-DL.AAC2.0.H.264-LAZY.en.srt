Come on, where are you?
Oh, this is almost too obvious!

164
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,125
Okay, I'll bite.

Oh boy, well, my alter-ego did
say he owned his own robot!

Wait, on the side of its head!

173

Those look like
sonic receivers!

174
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,375
This robot can hear me,
and if he's Spider-Man's,

175
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,958
he'd respond to verbal
orders from Spider-Man!

176

Robot! Put me down!

No! I command you
to destroy him!

hear you say that!

do is understand him.

never learn to do.

even if I have to do it
one dimension at a time.

really works!

What're you planning to do?

only this hole won't lead
to another dimension,

I've re-calibrated
the interphase inhibitor.

You've deliberately
created an imbalance?

Then whatever get
sucked into that hole--

306

Right! It will cease to exist!

307
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,958
In minutes, this hole
will grow large enough

308
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,333
to suck this city
into oblivion,

309
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,000
then the entire planet!

You can't do something
this horrible!

It just isn't in you,

312
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,833
because it isn't in me,
and you are me!

313
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:31,083
I'm more you than
you'd ever imagine!

314
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,083
And maybe you're being
overtaken by the symbiote,

315
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,166
there's only one
way I can find out.

Peter Parker inside of you,

the one who cares about
the people around him!

318

He's gone for good!

319
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,833
Is he?
I know he won't talk to me,

320
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,208
but I brought along somebody
that he might want to talk to.

321
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,500
No, it can't be!

322
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,000
Peter? It's me, Uncle Ben.

323
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,208
Uncle Ben?

324
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,000
I've been told everything.

325
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,083
Is it really you?

326
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,166
Did you think things
were gonna be easy, boy?

327
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,083
Huh? Did you?

328
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,875
[Peter grunts]

329
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,375
But I can't do it, Uncle Ben!
You know my rotten luck!

330
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,625
Nonsense!
Boy, good or bad luck is

331
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,958
nothing but the
right or wrong mix of

332
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,875
opportunity, preparation,
and confidence.

333
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,083
Now I know you're
prepared because

334
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,875
I had a hand in that, we're
looking square at opportunity!

335
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,875
I know you've had
a very bad time,

336
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:29,083
but in this dimension,
I'm here for you

337
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,250
and no matter what, I love you.

338
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,875
I, I love you too, Uncle Ben!

339
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,875
I love you too!

340
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:42,000
Do you remember what
I taught you about great power?

341
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,875
Yes!

342
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:47,500
With great power there must
come great responsibility!

343
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,333
Peter, there's an
evil inside you,

344
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,458
it's your responsibility
to the world,

345
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:56,166
and to yourself to expel it!
Get rid of it!

346
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,833
Please!

347
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,583
Yes! I must! I see that now!

348
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,458
[Peter screams]

349
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,958
What's wrong with him?

350
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,583
He's trying to get
rid of the symbiote,

351
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,875
but it's not giving
up without a fight!

352
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,375
Fight it, Peter!

353
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,375
Fight it with
all your heart and soul,

354
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,166
your real heart and soul!

355

-[Peter screams]
-[Symbiote roars]

356
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,875
It won't work! Too painful!

357
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:22,875
I'm sorry for all
the bad things I did!

358
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,166
Forgive me!

359
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,500
Forgive meeeee!

360
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,875
No!

361
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,250
He's gone! Vaporized!
I should've stopped him!

362
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,500
No, he did what he thought
was best for himself,

363
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
and for all of us.

364
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,583
You did fine tonight, Peter,
I'm proud of you. I'll miss ya.

365
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,375
And I'll miss you too,
Uncle Ben.

366
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,125
But I'll always have you,
in my heart.

367
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,458
Way to go, boss!

368
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:05,125
You did well, Spider-Man!
I am proud of you.

369
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,083
The others can go home,

370
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:11,333
but there is one more place
that you must visit.

371
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,083
Where to now?

372
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,083
[clears throat] I think
she means my reality.

373
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,875
What am I gonna find there?

374
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,500
More than you can ever imagine.

375
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,458
I don't believe what
you're telling me!

376
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,875
In your reality,
I'm a character in fiction?

377
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,833
Yep, and I'm an actor
who plays you on TV.

378
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,875
But there's someone here
I knew you had to meet.

379
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:38,000
He's the man who created you,
for fans all over the world!

380
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,708
[man] And I said to Jack,
"What if his skin turns green?"

381
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,833
Uh, [clears throat] excuse me,

382
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,250
I'm looking for some
guy named Stan Lee?

383
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,875
What? Spider-Man?

384
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,875
Uh, Pam, hold my
calls for a while.

385
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,291
I think I've finally
gone crazy!

386
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,125
[Stan] Oh, man! Wow!

387
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,875
You know Spidey,
I've always wanted

388
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,875
to experience
real web-slinging!

389
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,250
And I've always wanted to
appreciated as a real hero!

390
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,875
It seems you've made
me into one! Thanks!

391
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,083
Hey, don't mention it!

392
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:19,333
After saving all of reality,
where do you go from here?

393
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,208
[Spider-Man]
To find Mary Jane,
my Mary Jane!

394
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,708
I've been told she's still
alive! I can't wait to see her!

395
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,458
You know,
for so long I've thought

396
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,875
that I never got
any breaks, but now,

397
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,958
after all I've been through,
for once,

398
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,958
I like my life, I like myself!

399
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,625
And for the first time ever,

400
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,291
I wouldn't want to change
anything about me!

401
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,125
Gee, you're definitely
not the same

guy I've been writing
about all these years!

403
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:50,833
Well Stan, we all have to
grow up sometime I suppose,

404
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,416
even us characters of fiction.

405
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:57,333
Spider-Man, it's time to go.

406
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,125
Who is that exotic lady?

407
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,583
Oh her? She's my ride.

408
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:06,000
It's been great meeting
you, take care of yourself.

409
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,625
You too, Spider-Man!
Farewell and good luck!

410
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,166
Wow, I wonder how I'm supposed
to get down from here.

411
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:16,083
I suppose I could wait
for the Fantastic Four

412
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,708
to drop by and give me a lift.

413
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,375
[Spider-Man] That Stan Lee,
he's quite a guy.

414
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,875
I think he's truly special.

Well Madame Web, where to now?

416

Face front, true believer,

417
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:32,625
we are going to find
the real Mary Jane Watson!

418
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,083
What?

419
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,000
It has been a long,
hard journey.

420
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And I think you are finally
entitled to some happiness.

Amen to that, dear lady,
amen to that.
