164
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,625
Don't chicken out on me now.

165
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,750
I ain't no chicken,
Mr. Jameson.

166
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,000
I just gotta know
what's going on.

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,375
Stop, stop!

168
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,458
Stillwell, what's
wrong with him?

169
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,291
He'll be OK.

170
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,416
The neogenic recombinator is
restructuring Gargan's DNA

171
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,000
to match the genetic
code of a scorpion.

172
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,458
I chose to use a scorpion
because it's a natural predator

173
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,208
of the spider, see?

174
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,000
It's working.

175
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,291
[whirring]

176
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:56,708
Spider-man will at
last meet his match.

177
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,083
[growling]

178
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,458
This is J3 Bravo.

179
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,625
I got a spider sighting.

180
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,833
Heading due south.

181
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,333
I copy that, J3 Bravo.

182
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,333
We finally found him,
Mr. Jameson.

183
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,500
Oh, man, I've got three
science papers due Friday,

184
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,583
I have to study all
night for a big exam

185
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,083
and I'm still batting
zero with Felicia.

186
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,000
[Jameson] Get ready, Scorpion.

187
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,708
I hear you.

188
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,750
If I didn't have web
swinging to help me relax,

189
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,250
I'd be wound up tighter than--

190
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,416
Now what?

191
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,000
Who the heck are you?

192
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,416
A real hero, you freak!

193
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,083
This is a joke, right?

194
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,458
Whoa! This is not a joke.

195
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,583
If you wanna join
the Fantastic Four,

196
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,125
you're in the wrong place.

197
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,125
Highly corrosive acid.

198
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,875
Why do I get the feeling
he's not into male bonding?

199
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,416
Where'd he go?

200
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:03,583
Look, I'm stronger
and faster than you.

201
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,125
[laughing]

202
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,166
[shouting]

203
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,000
Gotta get this creep
away from these busy streets

204
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,458
before some innocent
bystander gets hurt.

205
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,166
Hey, pal, let's go talk
this over some place

206
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,708
where it's just you and me.

207
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,458
[laughing]

208
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,583
That's it, Gargan!

209
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,416
Don't let up, get him!

210
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,291
Who's doing this fight,
me or you?

211
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,000
[Peter] Who are you talking to?

212
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,416
Wouldn't you like to know?

213
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,958
[laughing]

214
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,250
[shouting]

215
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,333
[man] Oh, my God!

216
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,000
You're dead meat, little man!

217
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,625
[grunting]

218
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,625
Go, go! Get him!

219
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,583
No, you're doing it all wrong!

220
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:14,583
Did you expect your
crummy webs to stop me?

221
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,625
The thought
had crossed my mind.

222
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,625
[yelling]

223
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,333
Yes!

224
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,125
Good move!
Excellent!

225
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,625
[laughing]

226
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,291
-[screaming]
-[man] Look out!

227
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,333
[Peter groaning]

228
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,500
[laughing]

229
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,458
How about that?

230
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,333
I beat Spider-man!

231
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:09,958
Taken out by the one,
the only, Scorpion!

232
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,583
Quit stalling, Gargan!
Unmask him!

233
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,750
What's happening to me?

234
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,333
No, no!

235
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,083
What are you waiting for?

236
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,583
Unmask him now?

237
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,833
I've become a freak, a monster!

238
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,708
Lower me down.
I'll unmask him myself.

239
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,083
[Scorpion] You tricked me!

240
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,166
You never said
this would happen.

241
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,208
[Jameson] What are you doing?

242
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,125
What do you think?

243
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,583
Getting as much distance from
that lunatic as possible.

244
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,458
No, go down, go down!

245
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,708
I am, when I get back to base.

246
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,458
Fire me if you want to but I
have a family to think about.

247
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,875
[sirens blaring]

248
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,958
Jonah, check the main feed.

249
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,250
Oh, no.

250
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,833
[yelling]

251
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,583
What have I done?

252
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,500
You?
What do you mean?

253
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,291
Robbie, I helped
create that thing.

254
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,583
You what? Why would
you do such a thing?

255
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,000
I did it for Julia, my wife.

256
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,083
Years ago, a crime
boss wanted me

257
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,750
to back off a story
but I refused.

258
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,333
One night,
a man came after me.

259
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,500
A man in a mask.

260
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,250
He aimed at me,
but he hit her.

261
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,583
Now I've sworn to
keep this city safe

262
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,333
from people who
hide behind masks

263
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,208
and think that
they're above the law.

264
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,875
That's exactly what
your creation is doing.

265
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:44,958
You've got to stop him.

266
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,458
You're right, Robbie.

267
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,875
I made a horrible mistake.

268
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,583
Every bone in
my body is killing me.

269
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,875
I'd love to rest
up but I've gotta find that

270
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,750
green goon before
he levels all of Manhattan.

271
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,583
Stillwell, do something!

272
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,458
Gargan's going berserk!

273
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,333
I know.

274
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,250
The genetic realignment is
making him mentally unstable.

275
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,625
Professor Connors was right.

276
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,500
Neogenics is too experimental,
too dangerous

277
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,166
to use on a human being.

278
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,166
[crumbling]

279
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,333
Stillwell, fix me!

280
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,083
Make me like I was!

281
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,625
I can't.

282
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,875
The process is
regenerating exponentially

283
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,875
like a nuclear chain reaction.

284
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,291
It's too far out of control.

285
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,375
Not again.

286
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,416
[groaning]

287
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,500
You lying...

288
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,208
[crashing]

289
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,875
You, this is your fault!

290
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,000
You want me to stay this way

291
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,958
so I can destroy Spider-man!

292
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,291
Ah, Gargan, what are you doing?

293
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:51,166
I'm gonna let you
live just long enough

294
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,333
to find out.

295
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,166
[Officer] Can we get
a shot at him?

296
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,708
[Officer 2] Negative,
he's got a hostage.

297
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,750
Stay back!

298
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,875
No, really, Aunt May.

299
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,083
Everything's OK.

300
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,875
I just won't be home for lunch.

301
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:12,250
But, Peter, I've invited
Anna Watson's niece, Mary Jane.

302
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,250
Oh, right.

303
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sorry, I forgot.

304
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,208
I can't make it home right now.

305
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,583
The traffic, it's terrible.

306
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,625
In fact, it's really crawling.

307
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,500
Look, Aunt May,
I've really gotta go.

308
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,291
All right dear, but don't
stay out too late.

309
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,875
You sound like you're
catching a bug.

310
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,166
[Peter] I certainly hope so.

311
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,708
What?

312
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,875
Nothing, Aunt May.
I'll be careful. Bye.

313
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,208
Did I just see Joe Jameson
with the Scorpion

314
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,208
or should I start
wearing glasses again?

315
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,833
That's the Oscorp
nuclear reactor.

316
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,166
Why are you heading there?

317
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,375
'Cause radiation
made me this way

318
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,416
and I'm gonna use
it to change me back

319
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,250
into who I was.

320
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,583
I'll punch a hole inside,
get at the radiation.

321
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,083
I think it's in the
middle somewhere.

322
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,083
[growling]

323
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,583
Gargan, you're insane!

324
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,500
You'll unleash radiation
on the whole city!

325
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,000
Not my problem, pal.

326
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,416
And quit calling me names.

327

but something tells
me I don't wanna know.

A nuclear reactor?

Uh-oh.
What's that alarm?

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,458
Scorpion just activated

behind that door.

Now they're automatically

Without them,
the nuclear fission

in the chamber increases.

344

If we don't get them
back in, then the heat

345

will make that thing blow

or the reactor will melt down

364

and the city will be
destroyed by radiation.
