Please, help!

177
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,333
Hey, what's wrong with you?

178
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,750
That spider monster
people are talking about,

179
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,083
I think I just saw it
in the science lab.

180
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,750
Lady, that monster story
is just more garbage

181
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,083
cooked up by The Daily Bugle
to slam Spider-man.

182
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,833
Spider-man's a good guy, a hero.

183
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,000
So, what are you saying?

184
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,458
I'm seeing things?

Hey, you're the
beaker brain, not me.

186
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,000
Wait a minute, you're
that ESU football star,

Flash Thompson.

Well, if you're so great,

190
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,416
the least you can do is
escort me back inside.

191
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,958
Lady, I got places to go.

192

Huh, some big star you are.

193

You're afraid.

194
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,166

195
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,500
Ah, come on.

It knocked a few things over.

You must've imagined
the rest, lady.

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,291
I'm telling you, that science
stuff is bad for your brains.

Oh, really?

203
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,833
And how would you know that?

204
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,875
You jocks don't have any.

205
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,125
Huh, you're welcome.

This is what I
live for, webhead,

00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:45,125
to stop monsters like you
from harming innocent lives.

On the television they

cross fire between rival gangs.

337
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,875
Don't you know that
nothing you do now

338
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,000
can ever bring them back?

339
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,625
This man has a disease.

340
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,458
He's trapped in this
creature's body.

341
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,000
He's a victim, just as your wife

342
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,125
and two children were victims.

343
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,875
The only monster here is you.

344
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,291
I'm listening.

345
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,958
I must administer this serum.

346
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,416
I need for you and
Sergei to hold him down.

347
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,000
Hurry, lady.

348
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,708
There, it's done.

[growling]

350
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,416
Take your coat off.

351
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,875
Drape it over his face.

352
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,375
What?

353
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,250
The man wears a
mask for a reason.

354
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,583
We must respect his wishes.

355
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,416
[groaning]

356
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,750
Here, put this on him.

357
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,000
I found it.

358
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,583
Thought I'd keep
it as a souvenir.

359
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:29,875
Huh?

360
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,250
Easy, Spider-man.

361
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,875
We're all friends here.

362
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,875
This man helped save you.

363
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:38,000
I feel like a just woke
up from a nightmare.

364
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,458
Well, my little Calypso,
you have done it again.

365
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,875
Calypso?

366
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,875
In mythology,
Calypso was a goddess

367
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,875
who offered the gift
of life to Odysseus.

368
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:51,083
Well, then, I guess
you're my Calypso too.

369
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,291
Let him rest.

370
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,416
Then I will help you
carry him out of here.

371
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,416
Wait!

372
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,458
If it is any consolation to you,

373
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,500
Spider-man is innocent
of the kidnapping charge.

374
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,875
It isn't.

375
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,500
Huh.

376
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,333
World Trade Center
parking garage.

377
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,833
How did you know?

378
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,875
The gravel that I found
in man-spider's webbing,

379
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:20,000
it still had the
scent of gunpowder

380
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
from that bomb
explosion of years ago.

381
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,875
Clever.

382
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,500
I'm impressed.

383
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,000
[Sergei] We would be
magnificent together.

384
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:34,125
Thank you for giving
me back my life.

385
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,833
What a beautiful day
this is gonna be.

386
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,833
I feel lucky to be alive,

387
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,125
and lucky to be who I am.

388
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,250
