You dare talk that
way to a scientist?

167
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,291
Scientist?

168
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,166
You're just a coward who
kidnapped a helpless girl.

169
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,458
Coward am I?

170
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,875
We'll see who the coward is.

171
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,500
I want you personally to
deliver the ransom money to me.

172
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,875
What?

173
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,708
Come alone,
unless you're the coward.

174
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll fax you
the instructions later.

175
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,166
He wants me to bring it.

176
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,083
[car screeches]

177
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,333
Hello?

178
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:55,875
Octavius?

179
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,833
Where are you?

180
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Show yourself!

181
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,250
[screaming]

182
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,583
Face to face at last.

183
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,458
I trust we're alone.

184
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,708
The FBI promised to stay clear.

185
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,333
Now show me the girl.

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,708
Sorry, I don't take requests.

187
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,458
If you've hurt her!

188
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,208
She's in perfect condition.

189
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,708
But as for you...

190
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,208
[Spider-Man] Hands up!

191
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,750
All of them.

192
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,458
[Jameson] Spider-Man,
what are you doing here?

193
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,083
That's simple,
you brought him, didn't you?

194
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,708
Me? I never.

195
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,583
You web-headed foul-up!

196
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,625
Hey, it's nice
to see you too, pickle puss.

197
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,625
You really think
your spider powers

198
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:58,166
can compare with
the shattering impact

199
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,083
of my unbreakable
hydraulic tentacles?

200
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,333
[Spider-Man] It was a thought.

201
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,083
Don't waste your time thinking.

202
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:08,875
It may very well be the last
thought you'll ever have.

203
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Your pathetic acrobatics
are no threat to me.

204
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,375
Listen carefully.

205
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,375
Now that I have twice
as many hostages

206
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:29,000
I want twice the ransom,
and I want it in 24 hours.

207
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,250
You're won't get
rid of me that...

208
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:40,958
They're gone.

209
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,583
I really blew it this time.

210
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,416
Who asked you to help?

211
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,333
If you'd kept out of it I'd
have my daughter back now.

212
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,500
I don't think he would have
released her, even if we--

213
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,583
Oh, now you're
a mind reader too?

214
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,708
For all I know, you might be
working with that lunatic.

215
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,458
I used to defend
you against Jonah.

216
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,125
Told him the city was
better off because of you.

217
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,625
Maybe I was wrong.

218
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,625
Coming from Robbie, that hurt,

219
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,958
more than anything Octavius'
tentacles could do to me.

220
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,875
The worst part is,
they may be right.

221
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,458
Listen to me,
sinking into self-pity.

222
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,875
That's not gonna get them back.

223
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,375
And if spidey can't do it,

224
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,375
maybe Peter Parker can.

225
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,083
This video just arrived.

226
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,125
[Felicia] Oh.

227
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,708
Felicia.

228
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,333
What's he done to you?

229
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,875
Time's running out.

230
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,458
I'll be calling you
at 10 o'clock.

231
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,291
Two minutes from now.

232
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,333
Robbie, I have to talk to you.

233
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,708
Not now, Peter.

234
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,375
It's about Dr. Octopus.

235
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,708
Listen, kid, we
don't have time--

236
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,125
You don't understand,
I know him.

237
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,458
He was my teacher.

238
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,000
We're professionals.

239
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,458
We know how to deal
with these situations.

240
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,458
But I think I know
how to get to him.

241
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,000
No, no, wait.
let's hear him out.

242
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,875
We're tampering with
the most important

243
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,708
thing in Octavius' life.

244
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,958
Science.

245
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,375
Unless we understand that,

246
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,625
Felicia and Mr. Jameson
will be...

247
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,166
[phone ringing]

248
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,458
Let me talk to him.

249
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,291
Hello, Dr. Octavius?

250
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,083
This is Peter Parker.

251
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,333
I was one of your students
years ago at science camp.

252
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,958
[Octavius]Hmm, Parker?

253
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,708
[Peter] You probably don't
remember me,

254
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,958
but you taught me how
important science is.

255
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,583
I've read every paper
you've published.

256
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,166
Sustained fusion-fission
reactions.

257
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,833
Neurochemical fusion.

258
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:32,291
[Octavius] What about
fusion potential

259
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,250
of the super-collider?

260
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,708
You never wrote that.

261
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,208
You were testing me,
weren't you?

262
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,875
[Octavius] And you passed.

263
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,500
Do you know about my
cold fusion battery?

264
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,958
Of course.

265
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:43,958
I'd give anything
to see that battery.

266
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,625
Then you're the perfect one
to bring me the ransom.

267
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,250
And after that,
I'll show it to you.

268
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,000
[Peter] Usually it's
the spider that traps the fly,

269
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,875
not the octopus that
traps the spider.

270
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,375
An abandoned rocket
assembly plant.

271
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,708
What a perfect hideout
for a loony scientist.

272
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,375
-Peter!
-[Jameson] Parker!

273
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,958
Don't worry, everything's
going to be OK.

274
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,833
I'll believe that
when I see it.

275
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,291
Is that the money?

276
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,708
Excellent.

277
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:24,208
Now, let me show you
the purpose this will serve.

278
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,458
What about Felicia
and Mr. Jameson?

279
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,375
Them, they can hang
around for a while.

280
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,166
Fusion energy,
billions of kilowatts.

281
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:38,125
Enough power to lift mankind
from the depths of poverty.

282
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,166
A power I will control.

283
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,291
Think of it.
A battery only twice
the size of this

284
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,875
could replace a dozen
nuclear power plants.

285
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes, but when you exceed this
size it becomes unstable.

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,166
-The last time it--
-You're right, Mr. Parker.

287
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,333
It blew up.

288
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,333
But there was a dividend.

289
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,708
The explosion that
destroyed my laboratory

290
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:04,875
also welded these
arms to my spine.

291
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:08,125
A neurologically
augmented exoskeleton.

292
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,333
It responds to my thoughts.

293
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:14,500
A melding of metal
to flesh and bone.

294
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,000
Incredible.

295
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,333
Reminds me of Flash Thompson,
all hands.

296
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,583
They let me do my work
four times as fast,

297
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:28,583
and they are the greatest
weapons imaginable.

298
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,750
Dr. Octavius, you've been paid.

299
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,958
Now release
Felicia and Mr. Jameson.

300
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,125
Release them?

301
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,250
Don't insult my intelligence.

302
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,125
But you've got your money.

303
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,958
A good first installment.

304
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,583
You promised to let them go.

305
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,958
What? A broken promise?

306
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,375
Sound familiar?

307
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,000
That's one of the perks
of power, my student.

308
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,708
Listen and learn.

309
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,291
[Peter] I'm no
longer your student,

310
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,750
and there's nothing
more you can teach me.

311
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,083
Oh, no?

312
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,583
[Felicia] Peter!

313
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,458
Even Parker
didn't deserve that.

314
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,875
[sobs] You--

315
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,625
You heartless freak!

316
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,166
Freak?

317
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,875
I'm merely the victim
of an accident,

318
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,125
and anyone
can have an accident.

319
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,000
[Spider-Man] Don't touch her!

320
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,583
Spider-Man!

321
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,000
You're making a career
of interference.

322
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,083
Some career.

323
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,166
No salary, no vacation.

324
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,333
And talk about on-the-job
health hazards.

325
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,375
Clinging to walls won't help.

326
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,958
My tentacles will turn
you into a blood smear.

327
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,458
I've got to find

A dynamo.

330
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,000
Dynamos make electricity
by spinning a coil

331
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,583
between the poles
of either a magnet

332

or an electromagnet.

You lamebrain!

You've started
the assembly test line.

337
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,583
When the rocket
engine's overhead,

338
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,708
it will fire on top of us.

339
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,833
Double jeopardy, Spider-Man.

340
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,500
If you manage to
turn off the dynamo

341

you'll face the full
fury of Dr. Octopus.

you'll live long enough

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,500
to see your friends'

know that you could

349
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:54,208
