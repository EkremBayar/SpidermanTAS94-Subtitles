or even a man-spider.

159
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,416
Why am I keeping
you on our payroll?

160
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,708
Why don't I just fire you?

161
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,583
Think fast, Parker.

162
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,458
Because I'm about to get you
the picture of the century.

163
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,583
Picture of what, smart-mouth?

164
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,958
Of the living vampire that's

165
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,875
really behind all
the trouble at ESU.

166
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,958
That is if you keep me on.

167
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,250
What do you say, Jonah?

168
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,125
Peter's never let
us down before.

169
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:26,458
I say you have 24 hours to
make good on that promise, boy.

170
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,291
Or you might as well
hock your camera

171
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,583
because you'll never snap
another picture in this town.

172
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,375
I'll make good, don't worry.

173
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,750
But I'm gonna need something
from you, Mr. Jameson.

174
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,125
What?
It better not be money because--

175
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,250
No no, not money, something
that'll help me even more.

176
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:49,000
How humiliating, at least
Jameson came through for me.

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,291
[Terri] Whistler, is
this Blade's mother?

178
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,708
[Whistler] Yes, he's
still searching for her.

179
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,833
He was devastated when
she abandoned him.

180
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,250
And the serum?

181
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,083
Blade requires
regular injections.

182
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,708
It prevents him from
needing blood himself.

183
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:06,375
It keeps him from
being a total vampire.

184
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,250
Shh, someone's coming.

185
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,708
-Well, can anybody--
-Who are you?

186
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,750
What are you doing here?

187
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,708
I'm Peter Parker,
Spider-man's sent me.

188
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,625
He does know
Spider-man, he's cool.

189
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:25,750
Knowing Spider-man
does not make him cool.

190
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,875
Just hear me out,
Spider-man has a plan.

191
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,708
[anxious violin music]

192
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,833
My Spider-Sense is
going ballistic.

193
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,500
-I'll bet Morbius is back.
-Peter.

194
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,083
Mary Jane.

195
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,291
I've had a hard time
catching up with you.

196
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,833
Now I see why.

197
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,750
Look, I can't explain right now,

198
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,333
can we talk a little later?

199
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,833
Peter, with you it's
always a little later.

200
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,583
I won't deal with that anymore.

201
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:57,000
I came here tonight to try
to save our relationship.

202
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,708
[Peter] Morbius
is getting closer.

203
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,000
What's the matter,
cat got your tongue?

204
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let me make it easy for you.

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,625
Just tell me you want
Felicia Hardy, and I'm gone.

206
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,291
What I want is to get
you out of danger.

207
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,208
Okay, it is Felicia.

208
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,875
I thought for a minute
we had a good thing going.

209
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,750
Shows what I know,
goodbye tiger, see ya around.

210
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,833
[Peter] MJ, I'll make this
up to you someday, I promise.

211
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,833
Parker, you may
never have Felicia.

212
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,416
[Peter] I have to play dumb.

213
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,125
-Nobody will have her but me.
-Who are you?

214
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,458
You do not recognize me?

215
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,458
I am Michael Morbius.

216
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,625
Morbius, you can't be serious.

217
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,833
-Dead serious.
-What do you want with me?

218
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,583
I need a sample of that

219
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,375
Neogenically-treated
blood you created.

220
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,208
I don't know what
you're talking about.

221
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,958
[Michael] Do not play
the fool with me, Parker.

222
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,708
-It's working.
-Give it to me at once.

223
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,125
Okay, okay, I've
got one in the van.

224
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,208
Get ready, Blade.

225
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,708
[anxious violin tones]

226
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,291
[Blade] You're mine.

227
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,458
[electric crackling]

228
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,625
You're in league with
that vampire hunter?

229
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,166
-Peter.
-Aunt May.

230
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,875
-What's going on?
-Stay back.

231
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,083
[Aunt May] Peter.

232
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,583
Aunt May,

233
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,583
no!

234
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,875
Don't do it, Morbius
please, let her go.

235
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,875
Give me my blood sample.

236
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,416
It's in my locker at ESU.

237
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,833
Now just ease her
over to me gently.

238
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,750
No, she is insurance until I

239
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,708
determine you have given
me the right information.

240
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,166
[Peter] No!

241
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,625
If only the generator
hadn't blown.

242
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,500
I feel terrible
about Parker's aunt.

243
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,000
Don't, this is war, sometimes
the innocent are sacrificed.

244
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,500
What's running in
your veins, ice water?

245
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Have you forgotten how you
felt when you lost your mother?

246
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,708
Whistler talks too much.

247
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,125
Blade, I'm sorry.

248
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,333
I didn't mean to
hurt your feelings.

249
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,208
The ability to feel seeped out

250
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,708
of my soul years ago, Terri Lee.

251
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:24,291
Learning to feel again may
not be as hard as you think.

252
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,875
[Spider-man] I'm glad
somebody has time

253
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,583
to enjoy themselves when
there's so much at stake.

254
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,083
How dare you, if
you'd been there,

255
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,416
we might have saved
the Parker woman.

256
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,875
[Spider-man] We don't
have time to argue.

257
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,208
We need to make another plan.

258
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,583
I'm tired of this
teamwork garbage.

259
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,458
I'll finish this mission myself.

260
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,125
[Spider-man] I'm sick of
hearing of you and your mission.

261
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,875
It's not like any
of your brilliant

262
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,750
weapons and schemes have worked.

263
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,125
Why don't you all go
back into the cave

264
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,458
you flew out of,
I'm working alone again.

265
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,458
Aunt May is with that madman,

266
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,583
I've gotta find
him but how, where?

267
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,208
Of course.

268
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:11,875
Lucky for you, I have
already fed tonight.

269
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:16,708
That sedative I've given you
should keep you out of my way.

270
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:21,291
Soon my darling Felicia,
we will be together again,

271
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,875
forever.

272
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,875
[Spider-man] Morbius will
come here to Felicia.

273
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,583
She'll be the first
human he'll want to

274
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,416
turn into a vampire and
I'll be ready for him.

275
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,583
Hey, what's this?

276
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,625
Tell me Mary Jane, I mean I've

277
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,708
been asking you out for
months with no luck.

278
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,250
What made you finally say yes?

279
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,875
Harry, I'll never
forget how you bravely

280
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,833
tried to protect me from
that man-spider creature.

281
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,375
Thank you for making me feel

282
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,000
like the most special
woman in the world.

283
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,708
You are special
to me, Mary Jane.

284
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,958
[Spider-man] Mary
Jane, I brushed her off

285
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,708
and right into the
arms of my best friend.

286
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,875
Now May is in the
arms of a vampire.

287
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,166
What else could go wrong?

288
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,375
[Michael] Felicia,

289
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,875
my love.

290
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,166
Who,

291
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,416
who's there?

292
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,000
It feels like an eternity since

293
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,333
we've kissed in the band tower.

294
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,708
Michael?

295
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:19,375
Oh Michael, I
missed you so much.

296
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,875
Where have you [gasp, scream]--

297
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,333
[Spider-man] Felicia!
I'm too late, he's got her.

298
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,750
Gotta stay on his tail,

299
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,000
if I lose him now,
I lose everything.

300
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:39,125
[anxious rock music]

301
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,958
What are we doing here?

302
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,875
Michael, it was you.

303
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,625
You're the one responsible
for the plasma disease.

304
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:57,875
Yes but it is also
true that I am immortal

305
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,708
and you my love, you
will be just like me.

306
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,083
We will be together forever.

307
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,458
[scream]

308
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,458
Thanks, that was close.

309
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:21,125
And no accident, it was a
trap, he's expecting us.

310
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:34,000
How about a blast of solar
radiation, instant fry you.

311
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,875
No, don't hurt him.

312
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,875
Let me take him into custody.

313
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,333
He's a vampire,
you destroy them.

314
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,708
Blade, human beings don't
