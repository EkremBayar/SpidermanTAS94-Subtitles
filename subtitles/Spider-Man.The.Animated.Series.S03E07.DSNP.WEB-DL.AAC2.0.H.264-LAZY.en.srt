through is unforgivable!

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,625
I don't care
what trouble he's in!

163
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,375
His place is here
with his ailing aunt.

164
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,958
If I were Peter Parker,
wild horses couldn't
keep me away.

165
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:14,083
I swear, sometimes I think
May would be better off

166
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,250
if they caught Peter
and locked him up until--

167
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,250
Aunt Anna, that's enough!

168
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,000
I won't listen to this anymore!

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,250
What was that all about?

170
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,416
Mary Jane doesn't like hearing
bad things about Peter.

171
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,458
[Harry] You okay?

172
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,333
Not really, Harry, no.

173
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,250
It's Peter,
I'm so worried about him!

174
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,875
[Matt] The data on this disc

175
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,583
proves that my client
is innocent!

176
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,291
How did you get it?

177
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,625
Let's just say Peter has
people looking out for him.

178
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,000
I need a receipt.
It's the only copy.

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,166
Time is of the essence,
Mr. Murdock.

180
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,625
My people are tracking Parker.

181
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,750
They might shoot him on sight.

182
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,458
Point well taken.

183
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,833
I must make
immediate arrangements

184
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,125
to protect
and exonerate Parker.

185

What are you doing here?

191
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,083
There are police everywhere!

192
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,708
I need your help.

193
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,416
You haven't given
up on me, have you?

194
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,458
Never.

195
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,125
You can always count on me.

196
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,416
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--
Harry and I are--

197
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,458
I know. Listen, I must get
in to see Aunt May.

198
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,750
Can you think of a way?

199
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,750
Leave it to me!

200
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,083
Oh, there you are, Dr. Peters!

201
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,000
Mrs. Parker's taken
a turn for the worse. Hurry!

202
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,416
[somber music]

203
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,958
Aunt May, can you hear me?

204
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,833
Peter, you-- you're here!

205
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,458
Everything's gonna be okay.

206
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,000
Mr. Murdock has evidence
that will clear me!

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,208
I told them you were innocent.

208
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,458
My Peter is a good boy!

209
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,000
She should rest now, Peter.

210
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,291
I'd better get out of here.

211
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,250
I may be placing
both of you in danger.

212
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,125
-[thinking] Now what?
-You!

213
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,875
Why, of all the nerve!

215
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,291
She must be really mad at me!

216
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,458
Oh, Anna, it's wonderful!

217
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,583
That nice lawyer, Mr. Murdock,

218
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,375
has proof
that Peter is innocent!

219
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm happy to hear it,
Peter, really.

220
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I've gotta go.

221
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,500
There are still a few people
who haven't heard the news.

222
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,875
I see. Then you need help
getting out of here.

223
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,583
Let me do what I can.

224
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,416
Why is my spider sense
still going crazy?

225
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,166
Oh, excuse me, Doctor,

226
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,333
have you seen
my niece Mary Jane?

227
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,333
It's sure nice of you
to help, Aunt Anna.

228
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,208
Oh, I'm not doing this
entirely for Peter.

Nice work, Agent Choi.

236
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,875

in you would pay off.

Thanks for calling me
right away, Detective Lee.

241
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:49,333
That disc was Parker's
one chance to be exonerated.

242
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,583
There'll be the devil
to pay for this!

243
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,458
The data on this disc
could've destroyed my father.

244
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,833
He'll be pleased
with all we've done.

245
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,000
What is it, Richard?

246
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Father, I have
the data disc and Parker.

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,958
I've taken care
of all your problems!

248
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,708
Splendid!

249
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,833
I shall await news
that you've eradicated both.

250
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,208
You see, Smythe?

251
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,708
My son has cleaned up
your mess.

252
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,208
How touching.

253
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,083
It is. I must say,
it pleases me greatly

254
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,583
knowing that my relationship
with my son

255
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,166
is nothing like I went through
with my own father.

256
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,875
Your father?

257
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,583
It occurs to me I know
very little about your past.

258
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,250
What was your father like?

259
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,708
What is the best way to say it?

260
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:37,000
I believe,
"small-time hood" sums it up,

261
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,583
but my father
wanted more out of life.

262
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:43,166
He wanted to become
a member of the Mob.

263
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,083
As for myself, I was lonely,

264
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,958
ostracized
because of my weight.

265
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,625
My father had great dreams,

00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,708
but things never
went my father's way.

in his business pursuits.

276
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,958
I wanted
to gain his acceptance.

but you must name
your accomplice!

[Fisk]
Now I was all alone.

286
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,750
I realized
I was going to have to

287
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,250
learn to survive
or be destroyed!

288
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,375
And I did learn.

289
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,583
By the time I got out, I had
acquired all the skills needed

290
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:57,083
to begin building
my criminal empire.

291
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,833
I even took a new name-- Fisk--

292
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:04,083
but I quickly became
known as the Kingpin.

293
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,000
I used my mastery
of technology to break

294
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,333
into the law enforcement
computer system

295
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,875
and to eradicate all records
of my pervious criminal
identity.

296
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,500
Only one thing remained
to link me to the past.

We found him for you, Kingpin.

298

It is you!

299
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,458
Nobody believed me,
but I knew the famous Kingpin

300
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,208
was really my boy Willy!

301
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,583
Wrong!
As far as the world must know,

302
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:32,208
Willy ceased to exist
when you left him in prison.

303
