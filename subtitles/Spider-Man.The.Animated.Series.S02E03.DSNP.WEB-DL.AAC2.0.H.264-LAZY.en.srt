00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,708
so leave me alone.

167
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,166
At least I never ran out on
you like your father did.

168
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,750
You shut up about him.

169
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,125
We were wrong for each
other two years ago

170
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,583
and we're wrong now.

171
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,000
That's all I came to tell you.

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,375
Mary Jane.

173
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,416
No, wait!

174
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,416
Hey, where did that guy go?

175
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,708
Morrie?

176
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,375
Hey, hey, I know why you
broke up with me, Mary Jane.

177
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,458
I had no car,
no cash, no class.

178
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,583
I was a nobody.

179
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,125
How did he beat me here?

180
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,000
You just don't understand.

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,583
Oh, but I do.

182
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,375
Things are different now.

183
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:12,208
I can give you everything
you've ever dreamed of.

184
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,583
You must come with me.

185
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,875
There's something
I have to show you.

186
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,708
I don't have to do anything.

187
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,875
Leave me alone.

188
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,875
Fine.
Have it your way.

189
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,833
I'll show you what I'm talking
about right here.

190
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,875
Kumbaya!

191
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,708
[people yelling]

192
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,708
Not too shabby, huh, Red?

193
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,333
How did you do that?

194
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,250
As long as
I'm close enough to it,

195
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,250
I can control all
the water around me.

196
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,875
What do you think?

197
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,625
I think you're
crazier than ever.

198
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,625
Hold it.

199
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,166
What are you doing here?

200
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,333
A 500-foot geyser
in Washington Square

201
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,333
and you're wondering
why I'm here?

202
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,833
I said hold it.

203
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:00,166
Is the bigshot hero stuck?

204
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,708
Let me give you a hand.

205
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,625
[grunting] Am I losing my mind?

206
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,083
Did he just turn into liquid?

207
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,083
Now do you understand?

208
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,250
I've been transformed.

209
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,625
I can do anything.

210
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,750
I can give you
whatever you want.

211
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't want anything from you.

212
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Red, wait.

213
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,000
[Mary Jane screaming]

214
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,625
Somebody call the cops.

215
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,458
No, call the lifeguard.

216
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,708
...eat your heart out.

217
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,583
This has nothing to do with
you, Spider-Man so butt out.

218
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,166
I can't. They'd take away
my superhero license.

219
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:52,000
Anyway, there's a strict no
surfing rule in the park, dude.

220
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,750
Pathetic.

221
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,083
You don't really
think you can match

222
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,125
the power of Hydro-Man, do you?

223
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:06,875
[Spider-Man coughing]

224
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,708
Did you say Hydrant-Man?

225
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,833
The dogs must love you.

226
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:15,000
It's Hydro-Man and
it's the last name
you'll ever hear.

227
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,458
For somebody new to
this super-villain gig

228
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,708
you've sure got
the cliches down.

229
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:25,833
The itsy bitsy spider
went up the water spout.

230
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:30,208
Down came the rain to
wash the spider out.

231
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,000
[tense music]

232
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,875
Forget your water wings, dude?

233
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,583
[tense music]

234
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,458
I'm running out of air.

235
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,333
Bench is waiting
for me up top.

236
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,083
Maybe I can go the other way.

237
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,083
That's water under the bridge

238
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,166
but I'll bet that
barely slowed him down.

239
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,291
I'd better find MJ before
Don Juan in a bottle does.

240
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,708
[Mary Jane screaming]

241
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,500
Relax, it's just me.

242
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,083
Would you please
just put me down?

243
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,208
Sorry.

244
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,583
I just didn't want to make it

245
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,958
too easy for him
to find you, Miss...

246
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,958
Watson.
Mary Jane Watson.

247
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,375
-I'm--
-I know who you are.

248
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,208
I have a TV.

249
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,750
I appreciate the rescue

250
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,833
but I'm just a little
tired of weird men

251
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,500
making unscheduled
appearances in my life.

252
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,708
Speaking of weird,
who is that guy?

253
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,625
He's name is Morrie Bench.

254
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,958
I'm embarrassed to say I used
to date him in high school.

255
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,958
He seemed nice enough at first,

256
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,833
but he turned out
to be a big mistake.

257
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,166
I sure can pick 'em.

258
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,291
And what about the--

259
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,375
The turning into water thing?

260
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,000
That's new.

261
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,458
I don't recall him
doing that at the prom.

262
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,625
I don't think this
guy is gonna give up.

263
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,708
You'd better take this.

264
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,416
What is it?

265
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,750
It's a way for me to be
around if you need me.

266
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,583
Do you want me to
web-swing you home?

267
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,583
Thanks, but I'd rather
just take a cab.

268
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,958
Man, now I know why she's
been so afraid to commit.

269
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,958
This lady hasn't had much
luck with relationships.

270
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,500
Let's hope Bench's liquid form

271
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,458
is as good a catalyst
as regular old H2O.

272
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:26,166
If so, this little solution
might just do the trick.

273
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,166
I hope.

274
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,000
Hey, Liz.

275
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,708
-Do you know where I can find--
-Mary Jane?

276
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,291
Yeah, she's hiding out at
my place pretty shaken up.

277
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,375
Here's the address.

278
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,583
You should look in on her.

279
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,583
[Peter] Thanks, Liz.

280
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,291
[Liz] Stay cool, Parker.

281
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,625
Guess we are not so
different, huh, Dad?

282
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,583
When things got tough,
I turned tail and ran, too

283
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,625
but not for long.

284
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,708
The difference between us
is I'm not gonna run anymore

285
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,208
no matter what.

286
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,125
[Mary Jane gasping]

287
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,750
Morrie!

288
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,750
MJ needs me as a friend
now more than ever.

289
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,708
[Mary Jane screaming]

290
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,708
Oh no, too late.

291
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,083
[tense music]

292
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,166
Mary Jane?

293
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,333
No!

294
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,958
[Mary Jane screaming]

295
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,083
A spider tracer.

296
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,708
-Horrible.
-She's gone.

297
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,166
No.

298
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,750
That's what
he wants us to think.

299
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,000
She's got to be alive
but where?

300
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:37,875
Sorry about the bumpy trip,
but I needed to show you this.

301
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,333
It's you.

302
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,083
You're behind
all the robberies.

303
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,208
Right.

304
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,125
I'm not a small-timer anymore.

305
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,125
How did you get this way?

306
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,708
Remember when I was
expelled from school?

307
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:52,083
After that my parents made
me enlist in the navy.

308
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,250
And they said it was to
keep me out of trouble.

309
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,375
Oh, but you were right
to dump, Mary Jane,

310
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,291
'cause I had nothing.

311
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,500
I was a nobody.

312
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,708
Even after I was transferred
to special research,

313
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,416
I was still a loser.

314
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:08,458
Then last month,
a miracle happened.

315
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,750
Something deep inside
the Earth changed me.

316
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,583
Turned me from a nothing
into a something.

317
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,208
Now I had power.

318
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,166
[Morrie laughing evilly]

319
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:28,208
Now I could have anything
in the world I wanted.

320
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,708
And I want you.

321
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,125
Well, guess what.

322
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,708
I'm not a thing, I'm a person.

323
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,333
Don't you get it?

324
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,125
I don't want to own you.

325
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,708
I want to love you.

326
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:44,250
I want you to remember
that you love me.

327
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,458
Morrie, listen to me.
