00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,333
I'll stand, thanks.

165
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,000
It is usually a good idea
to have a seat

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,250
when your world is about to be

167
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,000
-turned upside down.
-[snaps]

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,458
Whoa!

169
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,166
Huh?

170
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,708
You are about to embark
on a period of training

171
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:01,500
for a mission
I will soon require of you.

172
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,416
The only thing I'm embarking on
is a trip outta here.

173
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:08,833
Parker, this is one situation
you cannot crawl away from.

174
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,583
[grunts]

175
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,375
[Madame Web] In order
to succeed in this mission,

176
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,250
you must first
overcome the self-pity

177
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,708
that threatens
to end your career.

178
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,125
Oof!

179
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,708
What do you need me for?

180
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,458
You obviously
have powers of your own.

181
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,333
[Madame Web]
Powers are nothing.

182
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:28,708
More important is your tendency
to question yourself.

183
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,833
That is an interesting quality.

184
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,500
Tedious, but interesting.

185
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,708
Whoa!

186
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,500
[Madame Web]
This is your card.

187
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,000
No, thanks.

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,708
I'm not what
you'd call a believer.

189
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,958
[Madame Web]
Not so easy, is it?

190
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:48,583
It is telling you
that you must believe in me,

191
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:52,333
and you must have
the faith of a child.

192
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,875
What's that supposed to mean?

193
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,750
-[vortex whooshing]
-No! Wait!

194
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,583
Did I just take a trip through
the Twilight Zone or what?

195
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:03,166
This kind of weird stuff
is why I'm quitting.

196
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,875
Hey, it's that letter
Robbie gave me.

197
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,000
How did it get here?

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,833
Huh.

199
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:13,500
Madame Web did say something
about the faith of a child.

200
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,125
There, Spider-Man.

201
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,291
This is your best picture ever.

202
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,583
[Spider-Man] Thank you,
Maria Taina Elizando.

203
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,416
Huh? Who's there?

204
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,416
Just your friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man.

205
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,958
Spider-Man!

206
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,083
Is this a dream?

207
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,000
No, I'm really here,

208
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,708
just as your parents
asked for in their letter.

209
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,000
They what?

210
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,125
Wow!
It really is you.

211
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,000
Can you do something for me?
Please?

212
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,625
Sure, Maria, what is it?

213
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't call me Maria.

214
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,416
Only my mom calls me Maria.

215
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,750
Everybody else calls me Taina.

216
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,500
Okay, Taina.

217
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,875
So now that I'm here,
what did you want to tell me?

218
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,500
That I'm your
greatest fan ever,

219
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,250
and I wanted to show you this.

220
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,333
My Spider-Man collection.

221
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,416
Look.
I even have the first story

222
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,583
The Bugle ever ran about you.

223
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,166
You didn't believe it, did you?

224
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:06,000
Nah. They say a lot
of silly things in there.

225
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But the pictures are good.

226
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,625
Like this one
by that Peter Parker guy.

227
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,000
Do you know him?

228
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,458
Sometimes too well.

229
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,875
I cut out this ad
from when you were on TV.

230
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,708
Oh, this takes me back.

231
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,583
That's when I thought
I could use my powers

232
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,750
to make lots of money.

233
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,708
Where did you get your powers?

234
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,208
Timmy says you're
from a dying planet,

235
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,583
and your parents sent you here
in little a spaceship.

236
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:32,000
I think Timmy has me confused
with someone else.

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,583
I'm actually an accident.

238
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,333
An accident?

239
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,250
Yes. It all started
when I was in high school.

240
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,958
-I was actually
kind of a nobody.
-Who were you?

241
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,500
I'm gonna have to keep
my name to myself,

242
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,333
but I can tell you
what my life was like.

243
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,166
Hi, Liz.

244
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,000
I was wondering
if you'd like

245
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,500
to go downtown
to a science demonstration
with me.

246
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,875
Now, let me see, Peter,

247
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,583
should I go to the big party

248
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,583
with Flash Thompson
and have a really great time,

249
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,000
or go to the science
demonstration with you

250
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,083
and be bored to tears?

251
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,833
Oh, I just don't know.

252
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,750
Well, actually, this is
going to be a demonstration

253
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,125
of an exciting new technology
called Neogenics.

254
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,125
[Flash]
No contest, bookworm.

255
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,458
Liz and I have
some partying to do.

256
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,083
Whoa! Ooh!

257
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,458
-[Flash laughing]
-[Liz] See you around, Peter.

258
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,583
-But-- But--
-[Liz laughing]

259
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,125
[Taina] This is pitiful,
Spider-Man.

260
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,333
You really let him
get away with that?

261
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:27,000
Hey, I wasn't quite as strong
back then as I am now.

262
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,458
[Doctor Octopus]
The long and irritating saga

263
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,458
of Spider-Man is about to end.

264
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:39,291
He will meet defeat
at the hands
of my new Octobot.

265
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,125
Its arms
are powerful, agile,

266
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,083
and controlled
by my very thoughts.

267
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,291
Two octopi
for the price of one.

268
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,750
So did you go
to the demonstration?

269
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,333
Oh, I went all right.

270
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,625
It was
at Empire State University.

271
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,458
It was being given
by a famous professor.

272
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,875
Wow, Professor Stillwell.

273
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,250
Can you actually
harness radioactivity

274
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,500
for genetic experiments
with this device?

275
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,583
Of course. I'll demonstrate.

276
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,250
[Spider-Man]
But unbeknownst to us,

277
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,000
just as he activated
the device,

278
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,416
a small spider
dropped down right in the path

279
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,416
of the radioactive blast.

280
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,333
[thinking]
Ouch! It bit me!

281
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,958
Why is it glowing that way?

282
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,333
Is it radioactive?

283
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,000
I feel so strange.

284
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,708
Yikes!
Did you go to the hospital?

285
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:29,416
No, I probably should have,
but I didn't know what to do.

286
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,958
What's the matter, Parker?

287
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,708
Did our little demonstration
upset you?

288
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,333
[laughter]

289
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,458
[Spider-Man]
I ran out as fast as I could.

290
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,375
[thinking]
What's happening to me?!

291
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,291
I've been poisoned
by that spider!

292
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,875
I'm turning
into a spider myself!

293
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,458
Oh, dear! A spider?

294
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,291
Aunt May, it's me! Peter!

295
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh! I hate spiders!

296
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,125
[Peter]
Can't you hear me?!

297
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,416
I know how to get rid of you!

298
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,458
Noooo!

299
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,708
[screaming]

300
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,708
Where-- Where am I?

301
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,166
[gasps, screams]

302
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,083
-[frightened shouts]
-Hey!

303
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
[gunfire]

304
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,875
No!

305
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,416
You don't understand!

306
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,708
[sighs]

307
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:40,333
[Spider-Man]
It was just a dream,
a hallucination.

308
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,458
But my head
was still throbbing,

309
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,458
so much so that
I didn't notice
a car coming right at me.

310
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,166
-[horn honking]
-I jumped out of the way.

311
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,250
I'm sticking to the wall!

312
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,458
I can climb straight up!

313
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,500
[Spider-Man]
Somehow, when that
radioactive spider bit me,

314
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,625
it must have transferred
its powers to me.

315
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,250
I gained
a whole new equilibrium,

316
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,875
the agility of a spider.

317
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,000
The strength, too.

318
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,208
And a spider's craving
for dark corners
and new heights.

319
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,166
[Taina] Too cool.

320
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,333
Is that spider still around?

321
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,208
No, and it's just as well.

322
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,708
That spider
also caused me a lot of grief.

323
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,083
[Kingpin] Impressive.

Is that all you have to say?

325

judgment until I see results.

326

And you shall see them soon.

327
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,583
With a spider-seeker
to ride it,

328
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:32,375
my Octobot will
find and crush Spider-Man

329
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,833
and anything else in its way.

330
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,583
[Taina]
When that spider bit you,

331
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,625
did it give you power
to make webs, too?

332
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,708
No. I did that myself.

333
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:46,458
I make web fluid and store it
in small pressurized containers

334
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,500
that load into
these web-shooters I built.

335
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,875
Wow! You must be super smart
to think this stuff up.

336
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,458
I think when I was bitten,

337
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,875
the spider passed
on an instinctive knowledge

338
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,458
of how to combine enzymes

339
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,583
to make this strong,
sticky webbing.

340
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,708
The trigger
is this sensitive electrode

341
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,833
located here, in my palm.

342
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,583
It requires exact pressure
from these two fingers,

343
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,291
so that I don't
accidently activate it

344
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,333
when I make a fist
or grab something.

345
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,875
By adjusting pressure
at the nozzle,

346
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,583
I can fire
a thin, strong web line.

347
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,833
See?
Or a fine wide spread.

348
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,708
This is great.
Think they'll let me keep it?

349
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,291
[Spider-Man] I'm sorry,
but like real spider-webbing,

350
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,750
it's biodegradable.

351
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,083
It dissolves
in about an hour or so.

352
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,625
No wonder I've never
been able to find any.

353
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,208
So you made your web-shooter
and then went out

354
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,708
and started catching
bad guys, right?

355
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,208
Not exactly.

356
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,875
First, I tried show biz.

357
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,333
Show biz?

358
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,250
[Spider-Man] Yeah.

359
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,583
I made this very costume
so I wouldn't be recognized,

360
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,833
and I went
on a television show.

361

[gasping and cheering]

362
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,958
Even though
I was wearing my costume,

363
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,875
I felt like I was showing off
to all those creeps

364
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,583
in my high school
who thought I was just a nerd.

365
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,583
Then I met an agent
who made me
an offer I couldn't refuse.

366

Hey, sorry, pal.
I'm a wrestler, not a cop.

369
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,000
I figured,
why should I get involved?

370
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,500
All I cared about
back then

371
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,416
was taking care
of number one-- me.

372
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,875
The police were
at Aunt May's.

373
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,000

but he was armed.

Who did this?!

378

has been chased to a warehouse.
