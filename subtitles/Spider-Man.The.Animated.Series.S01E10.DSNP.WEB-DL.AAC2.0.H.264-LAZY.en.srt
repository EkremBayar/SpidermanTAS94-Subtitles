Doc Connors was right.

167
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,250
That alien takes over its host,

168
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,083
but since it tried to bond
with my DNA and failed,

169
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,375
it could even block
my spider sense.

170
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,083
Now what do I do?

171
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,833
I've gotta track 'em down.

172
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,000
Maybe I can find a clue
in his old apartment.

173
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,000
If that symbiote nearly
drove me nuts, I can imagine

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,958
what it's doing to a pumped up
lunatic like Brock.

175
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,083
[dramatic music]

176
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,458
Pumped up, that's it.

177
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,208
Brock likes to work out
by himself all the time,

178
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,625
and that might give me
just the lead I need.

179
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,500
[roars]

180
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,083
[Peter thinking]
Get a grip, Parker.

181
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,458
You're starting to lose it.

182
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,291
Uh, Atlas Equipment?

183
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,875
My name is Eddie Brock,
and I need to double check

184
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,333
the address you
sent my weights to.

185
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,500
OK, yes, that's right.

186
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,000
Thank you.

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,416
Here are those clippings
you wanted on Brock.

188
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,583
Why do you need them?

189
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,291
Uh, a school project.

190
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,708
Thanks, Mr. Robertson.

191
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,625
[Jonah] Hey, everybody,
look who's here.

192
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,583
[indistinct chatter]

193
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,208
Colonel Jameson,
what a surprise.

194
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,416
How're ya feelin'?

195
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,708
The prognosis is
that John's going

196
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,500
to make a full recovery.

197
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,000
In fact, NASA can't
wait to get him

198
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,875
back in command of
another shuttle.

199
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,416
Is that right, son?

200
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,708
Sure, so long as I
can shake the memories

201
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,875
of the crash
and the black alien ooze.

202
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,375
Dreams go away.

203
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,375
You'll be fine.

204
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,958
He'll be fine.

205
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,875
That satellite is being
launched tomorrow night,

206
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,333
they've named it

207
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,083
the John Jameson probe
in his honor.

208
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,958
[Peter thinking] That black
ooze isn't a dream.

209
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,500
It's my worst nightmare.

210
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,583
Spider-Man is finished.

211
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,583
I'm through.

212
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,166
There's nothing I can do.

213
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,750
Somewhere, he's out there,

214
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,000
and my spider sense
can't detect him.

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,750
He could strike at any time.

216
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,833
[Venom] Nice Spidey jammies.

217
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,833
Brock!

218
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,625
Wonder what people would do

219
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:05,000
if they knew
who Spider-Man was.

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,875
Hey, let's go ask
Jameson about that!

00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,625
Look up there.

225
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,833
Two Spider-Mans!

226
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,416
[growls]

227
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,583
Brock, the more you hate me,

228
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,458
the more the symbiote
can control you.

229
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,458
Who said we hate you?

230
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,583
Fact is,
we're your biggest fan.

231
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,416
Look, streamers!

232
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,083
Now it is a party.

233
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,875
[growls]

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,583
Disappeared!

235
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,875
[Venom] Revenge is
a human trait we enjoy.

236
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:05,875
We'll have our revenge
against you and the ones close

237
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:11,250
to you, like your poor
Aunt May or Mary Jane Watson.

238
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,458
-We know all about them too.
-You leave them alone!

239
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,083

Two of 'em!

00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,875
His webbing's stronger
than mine,

245
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,208
stronger than me!

246
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,958
Quite a crowd!

247
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,750
Perfect time for an unmasking.

248
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,083
No!

00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,333
[muttering]

[man in mask]
Check it out, Dude.

251
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,000
His mask is off.

252
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,833
I'm Spider-Man.

253
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,833
This is my chance to ID
that wall-crawling rat bag.

254
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,708
Gimme that!

255
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,375
Quick, somebody, what do I do
to make this thing zoom in?

256
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,708
Come on, hold still so I
can focus in on your face.

257
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:05,416
Ready for your closeup,
Mr. Parker?

258
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:13,291
When the world finds out who
you are, you're history, pal.

259
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,958
Think of all the lovely
folks you'll leave behind,

260
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,000
like Mary Jane.

261
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,875
She'll be so lonely.

262
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,958
Maybe we'll have to
keep her company.

263
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,291
How does that sound, Tiger?

264
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,291
If you
try anything with her.

265
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,750
Come on, hold still.

266
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,875
Blast, hold still.

267
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,875
Oh, clumsy us.

268
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,333

[murmuring]

00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,583
I was supposed to meet
Mary Jane tonight,

00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,375
but what if Venom
gets to her first?

Mary Jane, Mary Jane,
Mary Jane.

Oh, sorry I'm late.

That's OK, Peter.

277
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,291
I ran into someone who says
he's a friend of yours.

278
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,375
Don't you just love
the theater?

279
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,958
I know you do.

I hear you're
a wonderful actress.

We have to go.

285
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,833
[Venom] But you'll miss
the curtain, Petey.

286
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,458
What's wrong with you?

287
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,125
We're going to miss the show.

288
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,000
Brock's a weirdo, OK?

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,583
I'll explain later.

290
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,166
Just keep walking.

291
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,708
[Mary Jane] Why?
Nobody's there.

292
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,000
Peter, what's gotten into you?

I've gotta take you home.

Peter, tell me what's going on.

297
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,583
Lost him.

298
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,375
Who are you talking about?

299
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,958
Mary Jane, do you trust me?

300
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,000
-What are you--
-Do you trust me?

301
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,166
Yes, I think I do.

302
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,583
Then just do as I say,

303
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,875
and don't ask me
any questions, please.

304
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,166
[Mary Jane] OK.

00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,708
Uh, we had to leave.

00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,208
Really, why?

An old, dear friend of Peter's,
and you must be Aunt May.

315
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,500
Heard so much about you.

316
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,000
Eddie and I have to have
a little talk, Aunt May.

Be seein' ya, ma'am.

318
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,458
What a nice man, so polite.

319
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,500
She won't see you again.

320
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,583
[Venom] How would you stop us?

He'll never stop torturing me!

know just the way to do it.

No, no!

I decorated your new place!

[grunts]

We're going to turn
out your lights.

00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,583
This party is over!

We'll catch you
wherever you go!

There's no place on Earth
that we can't find you.

344
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,583
It'd be nice if there were

345
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,458
a couple hundred more
cars to this train.

[growls]

347
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,458
Now where is he?

348
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,958
[Venom] Ticket, please.

349
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,625
Sorry, big guy,

350
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,375
but I think we're about
to reach your stop.

351
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,291
He won't let that stop him.

[horn honks]

[Venom] Look, Parker,
we're booked for a round trip.

355
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,500
Next time, I'm flying.

356
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,333
The military base launch pad.

We're here.

Finally, I made it.

360
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,375
Now the hard part begins.

361
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:44,458
And as the countdown draws
to a close, let me say

362
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,833
that it is an honor
to have the very first

363
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,000
space launch in the New York
area be named

364
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,875
for NASA's brave
shuttle commander,

365
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,375
Colonel John Jameson.

One minute and counting.
Mark.

368
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,875
[Spider-Man thinking]
Bingo, the John Jameson probe.

369
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:10,583
Fitting since this
all started in space.

[growls]

371
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,708
Not too smart, Spider-Man.

372
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:19,500
Nowhere to run,
and nowhere to hide.

No, got you.

[yells]

379
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,166
Hope this launch doesn't
fry my molecules,

380
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,000
but if I'm gonna go,
at least I'll take him with me.

[screams]
[Venom] The noise!

385
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,000
What have you done?

Yes, it worked.

The roar of the rocket forced
the symbiote off Brock.

We have liftoff.

[Security Personnel]
Security launch control,

I have intruders in
the gantry elevator.

I did it.

I beat the most relentless,
unforgiving opponent

are you listening to me?

Huh?

Oh, sorry, I was just
admiring the stars.

You were saying?

I said, looking up at the sky
on a night like this,

it's easy to believe
that we're not alone.

I wonder what's out there.

I was wondering too.
