00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's our only chance.

169
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,708
Yes!

170
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,083
Well, what do you know
I finally got him.

171
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,875
Well, really the worse for wear

172
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,458
but the important thing is,

173
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,708
it's mine now!

174
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,375
All mine.

175
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,583
[evil laughter]

176
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,083
Mine!

177
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, every inch of
optical fiber,

178
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,833
every bite of information,

179
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,333
all mine.

180
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,208
Well? What are you waiting for?

181
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,708
[stammers]
My father paid the ransom?

182
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,708
I'm free to go?

183
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:55,500
Free? Nothing with
me is ever free.

184
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,875
You're mine now

185
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,083
and so is all of this.

186
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:07,708
Look at it, it's a worldwide
network of illegal information.

187
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:13,291
See? Instantaneous contact
with any place on the planet.

188
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,208
Oh, but I don't just
observe in here,

189
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,125
I control the information

190
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:25,500
and the better I control it,
the more money I make!

191
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Everything's wired
to this panel,

192
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,375
power, water,
security, everything!

193
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,875
I can stay here forever.

194
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,958
Then what do you
want from my father?

195
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,458
Revenge.

196
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:40,416
And now that I have you,
I'm going to get it.

197
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,000
[screen ringing]

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Evening, Osborn.

199
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You were supposed
to come back here.

200
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,125
What went wrong?

201
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,583
Nothing went wrong,

202
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,000
your wings
a true marvel, Osborn.

203
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,750
It helped me destroy
the Kingpin,

204
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,333
just like you wanted
from the start.

205
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,125
Then why aren't you here?

206
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,375
I've rethought
our arrangement.

207
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,958
Now that I've got
the Kingpin's empire,

208
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,000
I want Oscorp, too.

209
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
All of it, not just
your inventions.

210
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Are you out of your--
Why you--

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,500
I'll expose your identity
for all the world to--

212
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,583
Harry?

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,708
Say hello to your
old man, junior.

214
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,250
[muffled yelling]

215
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,750
[evil laughter]

216
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,458
This town has a new
Kingpin, Osborn,

217
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,458
and it's me!

218
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,958
Hobgoblin!

219
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,375
Come back, Hobgoblin!

220
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,583
You filthy, rotten, lying--

221
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:38,000
I believe the word you're
search for is traitor.

222
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Ironic isn't it?

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,708
You started this by
double crossing me

224
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,458
and now he is
double crossing you.

225
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,375
But he said you were--

226
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,583
That report was
greatly exaggerated.

227
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,416
Much like your IQ, Osborn.

228
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,125
Only a fool would bring
this down on himself.

229
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:59,458
It was because of you two,
trying to bleed my company dry.

230
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,125
You left me no choice.

231
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,458
Enough.

232
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,291
Recriminations are useless.

233
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,291
I suggest we attend to
more important matters,

234
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,708
like eliminating the Hobgoblin.

235
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,291
And how can we
possibly do that?

236
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,583
There's a secret
tunnel that leads

237
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,250
back to my headquarters.

238
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,250
We used it for our escape.

239
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,458
Therefore, we have
a way back in.

240
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,833
All we need from you
is a weapon

241
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,958
that can stand up to that wing.

242
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,000
A weapon?

243
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,583
I just might have something,

244
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:34,458
or perhaps I should say,
someone.

245
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,833
[Spider-Man thinking]
Aunt May,

246
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,708
I wish I could be there
with you right now.

247
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,458
It's midnight and I don't
see your son anywhere.

248
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,166
You were right.

249
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,250
I never should have
trusted the Hobgoblin

250
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,583
but I got one ace up my sleave.

251
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,458
I'm suppose to trust you?

252
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,750
We both want the Hobgoblin,
don't we?

253
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,250
Oh, I want him, all right.

254
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,583
This is it?

255
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,875
There's a tunnel inside
that leads to his hideout.

256
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,416
You better not be playing
games with me, Osborn.

257
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,708
'Cause if you are,
I know where to find you.

[dramatic music]

259
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,583
[Spider-Man thinking] Huh?
This doesn't look

260
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,583
like the entrance
to a criminal stronghold.

261
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,833
This is a different story.

262
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:30,875

263
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,583
Here goes nothing.

He's on his way.

265

Brilliant strategy,

using one of our enemies
to fight the other.

267
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,416
This should be quite a show.

268
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,000
[Spider-Man thinking] I wish
I had some idea of where I am,

but with all these
twists and turns,

270
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,875
I haven't got a clue.

Well, no where to go now
but up!

Sure I know where
you can get 'em.

But I want double
the commission. [evil laughter]

get rid of those extra mines

are in the elevator.

The web slinger must not
be allowed to escape.

Can't this thing go any faster?

318
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,166
I hadn't asked.

319
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,750
No more Spider-Man.

we'll take the stairs.

what you have to do.

out of here, Osborn,

heretic victory?

333
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:55,875
You're wrong, Smythe,
we're going to rebuild it

334
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,875
bigger and better than before.

335
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:01,458
The main thing is,
it's mine again.

336
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm sorry but there's
no improvement.

337
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:10,250
Peter, where are you?

338
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,583
What's wrong with him?

339
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,458
He took a fall.

340
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,583
He'll be OK.

341
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,416
What about the Hobgoblin?

342
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,333
-Gone.
-Then it's finally over.

343
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,583
No way is it over,
I've got a lot of questions

344
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,375
and I know you've
got the answers.

345
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,875
Maybe I do but that
wasn't part of our deal.

346
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,125
Still playing games,
huh, Osborn?

347
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,625
Like the games you played
with the Hobgoblin

348
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,958
and with your own son's life.

349
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,833
Let go of me!

350
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,375
What do you know? You think
I don't care about Harry?

351
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:47,291
The fact is I do but my
work was all consuming.

352
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:51,166
I was always away, do you
know what that's like?

353
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,875
Missing his birthday parties,
his baseball games.

354
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,250
Never being there when he
was sick and needed me.

355
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:01,958
But none of that meant
I didn't care about him.

356
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:05,125
It was just a matter
of making choices.

357
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,333
Maybe, I made the wrong ones.

358
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,833
Oh, what--what happ--

359
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,000
It's payback time, Osborn.

360
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,250
No!

361
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,375
Harry!

362
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,500
Osborn!

363
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,000
You OK?

364
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,583
[coughs]

365
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,583
Dad?

366
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,166
We're OK.

367
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,708
I guess he finally
made the right choice.

368
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,875
[Hobgoblin laughs evilly]

369
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:43,291
So you're here too,
how convenient.

370
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,291
[Spider-Man] Yeah, for me!

371
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,708
[Hobgoblin laughs evilly]

372
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,166
Let's get this over with!

373
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,833
I can't out maneuver him.

374
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,875
[evil laughing]

375
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,750
[screams]

376
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,583
That was for Aunt May!

377
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:31,875
How is she?

378
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,708
She's still the same.

379
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,291
Where have you been?

380
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,750
I, uh, I had to take
care of something.

381
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,750
More important than this?

382
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,166
That's what's wrong
with you kids today!

383
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,000
You can't seem to make
the right choices.

384
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
[sighs]
Thanks for staying, Mary Jane.

385
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,375
I know your busy
moving out and all, so.

386
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,750
-I'm not moving, Peter.
-You're not?

387
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,458
I thought I wanted to
but after this,

388
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,333
now I'm worried about
leaving my own aunt alone.

389
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,708
So I can wait.

390
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:00,958
Peter?

391
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,000
Aunt May!

392
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,375
Oh, we were so
worried about you.

393
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,875
Oh, it was such a shock.

394
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,458
Don't worry,
the Hob Goblin's gone now.

395
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:14,583
The Hobgoblin?
Who's talking about that--

396
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,375
It was your apartment, dear!

397
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,708
-I've never seen such a mess.
-Oh...

398
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:23,583
I don't think you're ready
to live on your own yet.

399
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:24,625
I think you're right.

400
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:29,458
And, Peter? When you saved
that nice Mr. Fisk's life,

401
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,500
you did the right thing.

402
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,500
Uncle Ben would have
been very proud.

403
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,958
[Hobgoblin] Don't forget me,
Spider-Man.

404
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm not going to forget you.
