Hang on, we just lost our power!

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,416
The engine is clogged with sand.

168
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,333
We'll have to walk.

169
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,833
My suit may fail like
the hovercraft if I fly.

170
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,083
Uh, I think I'll walk too.

[explosions echo]

If it gets any worse,

176
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,750
it might be wise
for us to turn back.

177
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,125
That's not an option!
We keep moving.

178
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,875
[Peter voiceover]
Boy, you almost sound like

179
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,583
you know what you're doing.

180
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,875
The fact is,
Moe probably does a better job

181
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,625
of leading the Three Stooges.

182

[tense music playing]

183
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,833
Smythe, I can only
spare one moment

184
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,833
from planning my
attack on the rebels.

185
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,416
Why did you send for me?

186
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,833
I thought you'd want
to see this right away.

187
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,125
Behold, my latest creation.

188
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,583
The Cyber Skull.

189
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,250
Brilliant.

190
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,708
Brilliant!

191
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:10,000
I have a little surprise
of my own, Smythe.

192
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,833
[Alistair] Doctor Otto Octavius?

193
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,375
The doctor here
has kindly offered

194
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,875
to share his technology with us.

195
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:23,708
Yes, I ran into a little
trouble with Doctor Doom.

196
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:27,208
He coveted my kingdom, Octavia,

197
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:31,458
and he annexed it to become
part of his new Latveria.

198
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,750
Now I find I must
make new friends

199
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,458
who will help me
regain what I've lost.

200
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,000
And so we shall.

As soon as you
enhance my new robot.

202
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,291
Yes, I will begin immediately.

203
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,416
Are you really going
to help Octavius

204
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,208
regain his kingdom?

205
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,583
Of course not.

206
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,708
Keep a close eye on him, Smythe.

207
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,583
As soon as he has
given us what we want,

208
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,958
let me know, I will
dispose of him.

209
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,625
Doctor, I find it
difficult to believe

210
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,875
that you work as a
servant to The Red Skull.

211
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:10,500
Ha, Otto Octavius serves no one!

212
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,833
As soon as I have
my kingdom back,

213

you might want to consider
me as your new employer.

00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,875
Hmm, I see.

You all right?

No, I think my power generator
just got damaged.

221

[Peter] This whole area
is full of seismic activity!

222
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,000
I should take the lead.

223
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,875
My Spider-sense will
at least give us

224
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,291
some warning of danger.

225
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,125
That's an excellent idea,
Spider-Man.

226
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,375
Black Cat and I will
take up the rear.

227
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,708
I was just wondering

228
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,375
how a beautiful young
woman like you, I mean,

229
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,583
how did you come to
be the Black Cat?

230
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,583
Oddly enough, it's your fault.

231
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,708
What?

232
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,375
It began years ago,

233
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,333
the beginning of World War II.

234
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,250
My father, as a young boy,

235
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,583
was hired by The Red Skull

236
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:24,166
to steal the Super Soldier
formula that created you.

237

Captain America!

238
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,708
Were you able to
retrieve the information?

239
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,333
They weren't Nazis,

240

you're trying to get me
to betray my country!

You're the Nazis!

When he realized how
evil The Red Skull was,

my father escaped
from the Skull

244

without giving him anything.

245
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,250
My father was the only
person in the world

246
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,250
who possessed that formula.

247
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,750
But one day, a villain known
as the Kingpin captured him

248
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,000
and forced him to
reveal the secret.

Allow me to introduce
you to your father.

As a test of my
father's truthfulness,

254
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,458
the formula was used on me.

That's how I became
the Black Cat.

Someone has managed to get
through the Sea of Vapors!

Incredible!

Incredible indeed.

336
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,000
You assured me Smythe,

337
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,625
that no one would ever be
able to get to this fortress

338
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,875
from that direction!

What is happening Smythe?

00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,250
There's a damage light on.

348
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,583
The robot no longer
responds to my commands!

349
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,583
The Guardian's
protective shields

Great shooting Iron Man.
We'd better get going.

I won't let him get away!

Cat, we've gotta help
the rebels!

The robots are pounding them!

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,458
Sorry Spider,
you don't need me now.

365
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,750
[Peter] Give it up Smythe,

366
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,166
you have no chance
of succeeding.

367
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,291
[Felicia] I have
to avenge my father.

368
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,000
This is gonna surprise you,

-But I agree.
-You do?

Octavius and Red Skull

would spend an eternity
fighting for this planet.

372
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,583
I simply wish to get
back to my father,

373
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,291
and you are the only
ones who can get me home.

374
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,708
If what you're
telling us is true,

375
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,625
help us save those
rebels out there.

376
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,875
I should be able to
deactivate those battle robots

377
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,333
with a few keystrokes.

378
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,083
The Red Skull must
have had Octavius

install an encrypted code

380
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,166
to deny entry to the
self destruct sequence!

381
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,458

I can crack that code.

me so diligently?

You're not going to
get away this time.

This is for my father,
John Hardesky,

we were watching the battle.

at the end of this passageway.

Tell him to let her go,
Red Skull,

406
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,416
and maybe I'll let you survive.

Ah, but I've grown
quite fond of this Cat.

Move away, Captain America,
if you value the girl's life.
