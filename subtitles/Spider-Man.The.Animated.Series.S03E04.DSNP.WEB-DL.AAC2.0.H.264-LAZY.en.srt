00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,500
Now there are two goblins?

168
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,083
What does this one
want with old flat top?

169
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,833
Hope the Green Goblin's trail

170
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,875
didn't get too cold while
I fixed my web-shooters.

171
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,708
The Hobgoblin originally
got his weapons from Oscorp.

172
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:49,708
This green goon's weapons
looked about the same.

173
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,416
Maybe there's a connection.

174
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,333
Problem is, I'm not even sure
what to look for.

175
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,291
Hey, it's Harry, and he
looks mad about something!

176
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,583
[door slams]

177
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,125
Hey, these are blueprints
for goblin weapons,

178
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,625
and goblin muscle
enhancing armor.

179
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,875
Is this what Harry
was after in here?

180
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,583
[glider engines roaring]

181
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,000
Harry? Is it possible?

182
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,833
[tense music]

183
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,458
[Green Goblin laughs]

184
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,250
My collection is
almost complete!

185
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,875
Soon, the final judgment
can begin!

186
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,875
[camera shutters click]

187
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,000
Guys, that's enough for now.

188
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,458
[Spider-Man]
Paging Lieutenant Terri Lee.

189
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,875
Spider-Man!

190
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,625
What brings you
to the big city tonight?

191
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,583
This. Do you have any idea

192
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,875
what these high profile
kidnappings have in common?

193
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,208
Yeah, but why should I tell you?

194
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,125
Just because you
saved my life once?

195
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,000
Twice, but who's counting?

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So far, all we know
is that the victims

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,833
are all on Oscorp's
board of directors.

198
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,583
Have you warned
the remaining members?

199
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,166
I was just about to.

200
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,583
You may not be fast enough!

201
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,291
This kidnapper moves
like lightning!

202
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,833
[Terri] Hey, wait!

203
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,000
[Spider-Man] Whenever
Felicia's mother is in town,

204
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,625
she stays here with Felicia.

205
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,708
I've got to get
to Mrs. Hardy before--

206
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,458
[explosion echoes]

207
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,166
[Green Goblin laughs]

208
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,166
[women scream]

209
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,416
Mrs. Hardy, no!

210
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,458
[laughing]

211
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:38,250
[Green Goblin laughing]

212
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,625
Leave these two alone,

213
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,333
and we'll settle
this just between us!

214
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:45,416
Are you joking?
The more the merrier! [laughs]

215
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,458
Aah! No!

216
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,583
[Felicia] Let go!

217
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,458
Double jeopardy, Spider-Man?

218
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,375
There's no way you can save
two of them at the same time!

219
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,083
- Is there!?
- No!

220
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,458
Are you all right?

221
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,708
What about my mother?

222
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,875
[Green Goblin laughs]

223
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,458
[Spider-Man] I knew
he wouldn't let her fall.

224
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,125
He wanted to take her hostage.

225
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,208
You've got
to save her, Spider-Man.

226
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,416
I'll do
my best to get her back.

227
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,500
You have my word.

228
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,708
[helicopter blades whirring]

229
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,333
The Hobgoblin?

230
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,166
No, someone new.

231
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,875
Take evasive action now!

232
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,500
Knock him out of the sky!

233
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,708
[explosion echoes]

234
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,833
The weapons aren't
having any effect!

235
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:39,875
He's too fast!

236
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,375
[grunting]

237
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,875
Aah!

238
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,500
[laughs] Didn't count on
me having super strength

239
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,750
or titanium cables,
did you, big boy?

240
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,291
[Spider-Man] Jameson, Hardy,
Fisk, and the others all gone.

241
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,958
And I'm up against a dead end.

242
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,250
Mary Jane!

243
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,625
Have you heard
anything from Harry?

244
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,958
No.

245
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,416
Oh, I hate myself
for saying this,

246
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,833
but I'm beginning to think
something awful about him.

247
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,708
Awful, like what?

248
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,583
These kidnappings in the news.

249
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,708
I think Harry might
be involved in them,

250
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,708
to avenge the death
of his father.

251
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,375
Mary Jane, that's crazy!

252
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,125
And maybe close to the truth.

253
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,875
You don't understand.

254
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,583
There's a dark side to
Harry that he keeps hidden.

255
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,125
It comes from the anger he felt

256
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,500
about growing up
unloved, lonely.

257
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,208
I've tried to be there for him,

258
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,125
but even I can't
help him sometimes.

259
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,416
What if that anger
has taken over

260
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,750
and driven him insane?

261
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,958
Don't you think it's possible?

262
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,583
[thinking] If I told her,

263
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,375
it would only make her
feel worse about Harry.

264
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,583
But would it make her
feel better about me?

265
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,125
Peter, what's wrong?

266
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,250
Talk to me.

267
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,708
No, I can't do it.

268
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,958
Harry was-- ismy friend.

269
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,583
He's also innocent
until proven guilty.

270
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,375
I don't know what
to think Mary Jane.

271
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,708
But I do know this,
if we love Harry,

272
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,958
we have to trust him
and stand by him now

273
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,708
when he needs us the most.

274
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,875
Where are you going?

275
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,375
I've got to be by myself,

276
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,000
and do some thinking.

277
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,333
Peter, even though
things didn't work out

278
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,458
between you and me,

279
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,000
you really are a good friend.

280
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,750
I care about you too, Mary Jane.

281
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,000
And I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you,

282
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,833
just in case Harry has
gone off the deep end.

283
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,583
[tense music]

284
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,083
Harry?

[screams]

286
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,708
Well well, someone spying on me!

287
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:04,750
Didn't you know that
curiosity killed the cat?

288
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,750
[laughs]

289
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,625
[Spider-Man] Good thing
I decided to keep
an eye on you, MJ.

290
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,500
[Mary Jane screams]

[tense music]

293
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,166
As with the others,

294
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,833
justice will be meted
out to you in due time,

295
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,750
my little miss!

296
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,958
But first, I must call
this court to order.

297
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,708
You are all charged
with the crime of hypocrisy!

298
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:01,416
A crime that destroyed
Norman Osborn.

299
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,750
You claimed to be his friend,

300
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,708
yet you filled
your newspaper with stories

301
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,708
to ruin his reputation!

302
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,250
That's a lie!

303
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,333
You called Osborn
a threat to humanity,

304
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:16,000
but who was it that
funded Dr. Otto Octavius,

305
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,583
one of the greatest
criminals of all time?!

306
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,000
You're mad!

307
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,500
Let us go!

308
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,083
And you, the worst of them all.

309
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:29,625
Your sins are exceeded
only by your girth!

310
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,208
Good thing I made your shackles

311
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,125
out of indestructible
titanium too, eh?

312
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,875
Justice will be served,

313
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,833
and all of you will
suffer for your crimes

314
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,166
against Norman Osborn!

315
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,291
[engine roars]

316
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:52,958
For justice is blind
no longer! [laughs]

317
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,375
[Spider-Man]
All you megalomaniacs

318
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,125
have such a weird
sense of humor!

319
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,333
Aah!

[explosion echoes]

323
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,458
[Green Goblin]
Yes! Looks like a mistrial!

324
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,708
This court is adjourned!

325
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:23,958
[explosion echoes]

326
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:24,958
Aah!

327
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,875
Somebody, help us!

328
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,708
What's your angle in this?

329
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,833
Saving your ungrateful life!

330

Why I oughta!

331
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,125
Mr. Jameson, come on!

[screams]

00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,375
Careful, my dear.

334
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,583
[Spider-Man] Jameson,
you're an old Navy man.

335
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,750
You drive!

336
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,208
Huh, me?

337
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,833
What about you, Spider-Man?

338
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,625
I have a goblin to catch.

339
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,625
[spider-sense tingles]

00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:19,833
Look out!

343
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,833
[Jonah] Wilson,
why did you do that?

344
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:27,500
Jonah, we have to rid the
world of both of those maniacs.

345
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,708
[tense music]

346
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,583
[Spider-Man]
Okay, Harry, now we--

347
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,583
Norman Osborn!

348
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:39,875
No no, that weakling was
destroyed in the explosion!

349
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:44,625
The same explosion
that gave birth to me!

350
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,875
The exploding gas gave me
great strength!

351
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,875
And of course
the Hobgoblin's weapons

352
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,208
were right there at Oscorp,
ripe for the picking!

353
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,375
But they no longer
were meant for him.

354
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,291
The gas saw to that!

355
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,250
There was only one true goblin,

356
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,708
the Green Goblin!

357
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,416
Me! Give me my mask!

358
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,000
I must have it!

359
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,458
Aaaah!

360
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,250
You don't need this!

361
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,458
It represents the evil,
ugly side of your life.

362
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,458
-Let it go!
-I can't!

363
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,833
You have to, for yourself,
and for Harry!

364
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,333
[explosion echoes]

365

[Norman screams]

No, stop staring at me!

367
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,875
I can't lift it!

368
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,583
My strength, going!

369
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:49,333
We may never get a working
sample of this gas in time,

370
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,166
and if we do, we have no idea

371
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,375
how long its effects will last.

372
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,833
The gas,

373
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:59,166
[normal voice]
it's wearing off, no!

374
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:05,625
I need my strength back,
need my strength.

375
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,125
I've gotta get us
out before we both drown.

376
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,958
[grunting]

377
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,833
Not enough time to move it all!

378
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,875
Dad, Spider-Man!

379
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,708
-Is he all right?
-He'll be okay.

380
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,125
Do you know
of a way out of here?

381
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,583
Follow me!

382
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,000
I found the blueprint
for this underground complex

383
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,958
in a hidden room
in my dad's office.

384
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,875
Apparently this was all built

385
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,083
as a secret weapons
testing site.

386
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,875
It seemed to me
like the only place

387
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,083
where my dad could've
escaped from the fire.

388
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,291
The blueprint showed that
there was an access tunnel

389
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,416
under the burned-out
part of Oscorp.

390
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,583
But it took me a while to
find it under all that rubble.

391
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,708
How did you get here?

392
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,125
Uh, I followed a kidnapper

393
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,375
who called himself
the Green Goblin.

394
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,125
The Green Goblin?

395
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,833
- Did you catch him?
- Ugh, where am I?

396
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,250
Son!

397
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,958
Did the Green Goblin
hurt ya, dad?

398
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,291
Green who?

399
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,875
I-- I can't remember anything.

400
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,166
You won't have to
worry about the Goblin anymore.

401
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,583
It looks like he was destroyed
back in that complex.

402
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,875
And from now on,

403
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:35,458
Oscorp is out of the chemical
warfare business forever.

[audience applauds]

405

A bold move, Osborn.

406
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:42,375
I am in full agreement,
for the moment.

407
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,375
This is not
a profitable business.

408
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,291
Too many complications.

409

[Norman]
I have another announcement.

410
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,500
I'm going to ease up
on the affairs at Oscorp.

411
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,583
I need a rest.
It's time my son Harry

412
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,583

in the running of Oscorp.

if you feel you're ready.

you stood by him all the way.
