00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,833
You see what I mean?

172
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,333
I'll handle him myself.

173
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,416
Hammerhead.

174
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,208
What an audacious entrance.

175
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:15,458
I am beside myself
with surprise.

176
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,875
I could destroy you right now.

177
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,333
Could you now?

178
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,875
Yeah.

179
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,500
But to show my good
faith, I ain't gonna.

180
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,166
Yes, but my faith
is not so good.

181
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:31,000
[chandelier crashing]

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,125
Did you really think

183
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,125
you could get this close to me

184
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,750
unless I allowed it?

185
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,750
Now why did Silvermane send you?

186
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,750
He didn't.

187
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,250
I came here on my own.

188
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,416
I wanna work for you.

189
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,083
What do you have to offer me?

190
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,083
I can tell you what
Silvermane's doin'.

191
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,583
Like how he's trying to
get the Tablet of Time.

192
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,583
So?

193
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,583
Everyone wants that.

194
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,291
Silvermane says
the Tablet of Time

195
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,583
ain't just some old rock.

196
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,291
He said it really works.

197
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,875
That is intriguing.

198
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,250
Let me get that tablet for ya.

199
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,458
No, I do not trust you yet.

200
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,208
But I will consider
you for other work.

201
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,375
And if you fail me,

202
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,250
then I will send you
back to Silvermane.

203
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,708
What is left of you anyway.

204
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,458
That new project
of yours, Smythe,

205
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:19,250
is it ready to obtain the
Tablet of Time for me?

206
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,708
Ready and able.

207
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,083
Debra, what's on
the agenda tonight?

208
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,708
Mm, the usual, Alisa.

209
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,000
Sterilize the Petri dishes

210
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,958
and tidy up the lab.

211
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,750
[horn honking]

212
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,375
Coming, Flash.

213
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,708
Oh, and don't disturb
Doc Connors either.

214
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,333
What's he always doing

215
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,333
around this time that's
such a big secret?

216
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,875
Probably some experiment

217
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,583
that'll help us get that
tomb's research grant.

218
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,416
I gotta run.

219
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,458
Bye.

220
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:53,875
Spider-man?

221
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,625
And Doctor Connors.

222
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,875
[Peter] So that's
the tablet, huh?

223
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,458
Yes.

224
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,708
We've had to encase it
in protective metal.

225
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,166
Watch what happens

226
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,208
when it reacts to
ultraviolet light.

227

[buzzing]

228
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,625
[Peter] Incredible.

229
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,708
But isn't it supposed
to make things young?

230
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,500
I'm convinced it can

231
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,625
once we translate

232
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,750
the instructions carved on it

233
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,458
and learn to use it properly.

234
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,333
I believe the
Toltecs stumbled upon

235
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,833
a genetic technology
miles beyond what we know.

236
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,708
That knowledge might
be instrumental

237
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,083
in curing your mutation.

238
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,583
[Peter] So I wouldn't need

239
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,875
these neogenic treatments
every 24 hours?

[dramatic music]

245
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,583
Not another robot.

246
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,708
Why aren't women
this attracted to me?

247
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,375
I can't stick.

248

of super slick compound.

00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,750
No, stay back!

[Peter] Am I seeing things?

255
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,416
Is Doc Connor mutating?

256
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,458
I have to get this over

257
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,125
and fly the toy outta here.

258
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,000
Sorry, I have to take one tablet

every night before bed.

260
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,500
Doc's orders.

261

[Alisa] Doctor Connors,
are you alright?

262
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm okay Alisa.

[Peter] This thing's
really slowing me down

264
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,333
but I've gotta keep it safe.

265
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,875
My life might depend on it.

Well, the mighty Spider-man.

How do you like my
new mega-slayer?

[Peter] Smythe.

270
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,291
I knew it.

271
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,333
Why can't you take
up some other hobby?

272
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,708
Joke all you want,

273
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,250
but this time I've built

274
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,625
the ultimate battle robot.

275
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,583
It's got missiles,
lasers, and pulse shock.

276
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,375
And it's humanoid design

277
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,000
makes it extremely versatile.

278
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,958
See?

279
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,500
[Peter] This landing
can barely support me.

280
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,458
I wonder what'll happen if.

281
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,583
Come on Smythe!

282
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,708
Is that the best you can do?

283
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,291
Insolent till the end, eh?

284
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,833
[Peter] It worked.

285
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:46,875
I'm outta here.

[explosion booming]

287
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,875
Robots.

288
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,333
I hate robots.

289
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,750
Now I've got you.

290
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,208
Joke all you want

291
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,625
but this time I've built

292
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,333
the ultimate battle robot.

What's taking so long?

296
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,625
Report.

297
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,750
Blast you.

298
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,875
[Wilson] What did you say?

299
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,708
I have the tablet.

300
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,583
I haven't gotten
Connors yet but--

301
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,750
Do we need him?

302
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,583
No, I suppose not.

303
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,583
I'm certainly capable

304
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,875
of translating it myself.

305
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,458
Then stop wasting time

306
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,166
and bring the tablet
to me at once.

307
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,583
[Peter] Wonder why he's leaving.

308
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,333
Hope it wasn't something I said.

309
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,875
[Curtis] I'm fine, just shaken.

310
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,500
Good, he's okay

311
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,958
and still human.

312
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,291
I'll talk to him
later at his place.

313
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,333
Now I've gotta worry

314
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,708
about the Lizard again.

315
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,000
As if I didn't
have enough on my--

316
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,875
Peter Parker.

Alisa.

318
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,750
[Alisa] Did you
hear what happened?

319
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,708
The Tablet of Time was stolen.

320
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,583
Yes, I heard.
It's terrible.

321
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,333
I never thought
something like that

322
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,458
could happen here.

323

[sirens wailing]

324
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,333
Peter, I'm scared.

325
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,625
Will you walk me
to my apartment?

326
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,000
Well, I'm really
not headed that way.

327
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,583
But I could make a detour.

328
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,708
Sure, the lab
work's kinda boring

329
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,833
but I've met some nice people.

330
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,208
Especially you.

331
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,625
Why don't we have
dinner sometime?

332
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:33,333
Well, I've been so busy lately.

333
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,750
What am I saying?

334
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,875
Come on, Parker.

335
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,458
Put Mary Jane out of your mind.

336
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,208
Mary Jane and Harry.

337
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,500
Look at them.

338
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,083
