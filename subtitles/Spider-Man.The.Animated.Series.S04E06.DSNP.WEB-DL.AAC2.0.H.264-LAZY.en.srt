162
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,166
to the Neogenic process.

163
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,208
No, no!
Get out of there!

164
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,833
-[screeching]
-Aah! Noo!

165
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,250
[Morbius] Like the vampire bat
whose genes I have inherited,

166
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,958
I hunger for plasma!

167
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:06,375
I let him down,
just as I let Mary Jane down!

168
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,583
But if anyone
can help Morbius,

169
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,458
it's Debra and Doc Connors.

170
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,750
They know more about Neogenics
than anyone else.

171
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,458
Still, it's risky.

172
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,708
I'm glad Felicia's
going out of town.

173
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,291
Being here for this would
be too painful for her.

174
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,458
-Ms. Hardy, your limo is ready.
-Come in, please.

175
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,625
-I'm just packing
a few last things.
-[TV reporter] Today at ESU,

176
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,500
Dr. Curtis Connors made
a shocking announcement.

177
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,125
He has discovered the body
of former ESU student

178
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,833
-Michael Morbius!
-[gasps]

179
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,250
Connors hopes to restore
this mutated creature

180
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,708
to his human form.

181
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,708
It's getting late, Ms. Hardy.

182
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,500
I can't go.
I'll call if I need you.

183
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,375
[crying]

184
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:50,083
[Morbius] It feels like
an eternity since we kissed

185
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,000
in the band hall.

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,166
Oh, Michael!
I missed you so much!

187
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,958
Where have you--
[gasping]

188
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,583
-Aah!
-I am immortal!

189
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:02,083
And you, my love,
will be just like me.

190
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,083
I can't live a life
that preys on innocent people.

191
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:09,333
I must get help to be changed
back to the man you love.

192
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,458
-[screaming]
-Nooo!

193
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,458
I will love you always!

194
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,625
-Michael!
-[screaming]

195
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,750
I'm going to need some help
on this one, Budgems,

196
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,583
serious help.

197
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,708
[Connors] Well, we've done
all that we can.

198
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,291
It's time to test it.

199
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,875
[Clay] Doc, are you sure
that he won't wake up

200
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,166
and chow down on us?

201
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,291
That shouldn't happen, Clay.

202
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,708
The restraints are secured.

203
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,708
We're as ready as we'll ever be.

204
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,166
[electricity crackling]

205
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,875
[alarm blaring]

206
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,875
Look, look!

207
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,166
[Debra]
Something's wrong!

208
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,583
I'm terminating the power!

209
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,291
The tray's coil blew!

210
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,083
It'll take time to fix.

211
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,000
Better take a break, Debra.

212
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Exhaustion brings stupidity.

213
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,208
[sighs] For a moment,
I thought we did it.

214
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,583
[Kingpin]
For a moment, so did I.

215
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,166
I am beginning to lose patience

216
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,958
with our Empire State
compatriots.

217
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,625
It was a brilliant stroke
of yours

218
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:13,125
to create the Herbert Foundation
solely for the purpose

219
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,083
of funding their research,

220
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,708
but they're close enough now.

221
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,625
I'll be able to handle
the final stages.

222
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,250
Good.

223
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,250
I will finally have
a chance to cure myself

224
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,708
and possibly
make us both immortal!

225
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,291
Where's the Black Cat?

226
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,875
She's usually found me by now.

227
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,708
Do you think
maybe she's still angry?

228
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,708
Eh, you're right Bruce.

229
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,958
I should quit whining
and just do my job.

230
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,708
It's time I visited Doc Connors

231
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,458
to see how things
are going with Morbius.

232
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,250
Still, I wonder
what Black Cat's up to.

233
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,083
[gun cocks]

234
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,583
[Whistler]
That's far enough.

235
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,416
You can put that thing
down, Whistler.

236
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,875
You know my name?

237
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:58,958
I'm a friend.

238
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,333
I'm here about Michael Morbius.

239
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,833
[Whistler] Unfortunately,
Blade's in Europe,

240
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,875
hunting a particularly
elusive vampire.

241
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,291
It's just as well.

242
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,458
I want to handle
Morbius myself,

243
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,750
but I need your help.

244
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,500
Why should I help you?

245
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,250
Because someone has
to be ready in case Morbius

246
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,375
awakens still a vampire.

247
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,708
Just know that I want
no harm to come to anyone.

248
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,291
Please help me.

249
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,625
I usually wouldn't
help a stranger.

250
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,833
Not even a beautiful one.

251
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,375
But if Morbius the vampire
arises again,

252
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,708
someone must be prepared
to save the city.

253
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,083
[gasp] Who's there?!

254
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,750
It's just me.

255
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,708
I wanted to apologize
for the way I reacted

256
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,000
to this Michael Morbius thing.

257
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,458
Look, I just want you to know,

258
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,083
if this is
that important to you,

259
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,833
then I guess
I'm behind you 100 percent.

260
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,750
Why, that's
the nicest thing you ever--

Shocker, get Morbius!

265
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,333
Piece of cake.

266
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,875
-No, they can't!
-They won't.

He's coming this way!

00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,416
I am weak.

274
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,083
I must feed!

275
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,000
Look at this,
you're experiment worked.

276
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,583
-[screaming]
-Sort of.

[spider-sense tingling]

278
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,000
Shocker? Landon?
Why are you two here?

279
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,083
Who do you think
the Herbert Foundation
was named after?

280
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:57,375
I, Herbert Landon,
paid for all of this!

281
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,000
Morbius belongs to me!

282
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,750

[Landon] Get him!

288
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,000
He holds the secret
to Neogenics.

289
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,708
Are you all right?

290
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:31,000
[groaning] I'll tell you
when my head stops ringing.

You! Why do you torment me?!

294
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,458
I never wanted it to be
this way, Michael!

295
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,833
Never! Come back to the lab
where they can help you!

296
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,875
Please.

[Landon] There he is!

No, Michael!

Michael, wait!

He's too fast!
He's getting away!

[groaning]

312
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,416
Are you okay?

Yes, thanks to you.

Sorry, you've got your secrets,

316
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,291
I've got mine.

00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,875
I wish I had time to
chat, but--

318
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,333
Black Cat, wait!

319
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,875
She's gone, but where?

320
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,333
I just don't get it.

321
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,375
Black Cat saves my bacon,

322
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,000
then she ditches me?

323
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,250
Isn't that true
