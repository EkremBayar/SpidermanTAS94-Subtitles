166
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,750
involving Spider-Man.

167
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,583
This one
at the Brooklyn Bridge Mall.

168
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,625
According to police--

169
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,583
[rock music playing]

170
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,625
[brakes hiss]

171
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,208
[Peter thinking]
It's time to go meet
my evil twin.

172
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,458
[people yelling]

173
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,333
[man 1, angrily] Stop him!

174
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,291
[man 2] Don't let him get away!

175
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,250
[man 3] Go get him!

176
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,208
[Spider-Man]
I'll never understand
why everybody thinks

177
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,708
they can be a superhero.

178
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,375
Just a cheap imitation,

179
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,500
but can't compare to my own
winsome charm.

180
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,458
-[man] Aah.
-[Mysterio laughs]

181
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,000
[Spider-Man]
I recognize that laugh,
Mysterio.

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,458
That fake Spider-Man
vanishes and you appear.

183
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,000
I should have guessed.

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He's just another one of
your illusions, isn't he?

185
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,708
[Mysterio] You're the fake.

186
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,833
[crowd indistinct chatter]

187
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,750
Don't be afraid.

188
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,875
I won't let him hurt you.

189
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,416
You're the only one

190
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,083
that has to worry about
getting hurt, pal.

191
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,583
I'm more than ready
to take you on.

192
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,458
But not here.

193
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,000
It's got to be the same place,

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,708
where you ruined me.

195
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,250
[Spider-Man]
You've got a little to much
gravel in that fishbowl.

196
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,833
I don't know what
you're talking about.

197
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,458
Oh, it'll all be explained.

198
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,291
Just follow the yellow
brick road.

199
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,750
[Spider-Man] Oh, my,
I'm beginning to feel
like a certain coyote.

200
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,750
[sirens blaring]

201
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,000

00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,708
[crowd yelling angrily]

203
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,166
[Spider-Man] What next?

204
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,583
Peasants with torches?

205
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,291
Well, you turned them
against me. Now what?

206
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,333
This.

207
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,500
[grunting]

208
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,625
[crowd cheering]

209
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,875
I always did like
a good cliff hanger.

210
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,708
[Spider-Man]
Ah, the old museum trick,

211
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,125
not falling for--

212
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,125
-[spider sense screech]
-Uh oh.

[helicopter blades whirring]

216
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,625
[pilot]No sign of him, over.

217
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,291
No one could hold
his breath this long.

218
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,958
Let's call it a night, over.

219
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,833
[gasps, coughs]

220
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,625
[Spider-Man] That's it,

221
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,000
next paycheck I'm definitely
swinging for a snorkel.

222
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,875
So Spider-Man's fish food now.

223
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:23,083
And the city
has a new hero, Mysterio!

224
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,333
A real hero.

225
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,375
-Gas bag.
-A man who--

226
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,958
[phone rings]

227
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,458
-What?
-[Mary Jane] Peter?

228
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,000
Just wanted to make
sure you're still alive.

229
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,875
Mary Jane. Oh, no, our date!
I forgot!

230
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,750
You sure know how to make
a girl feel important.

231
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,875
Uh, look, if it isn't to late--

232
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,750
Sorry, in my league,

233
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,333
it's one strike and you're out.

234
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,416
-[line disconnected]
-But--

235
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,208
Oh, that does it.

236
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,958
My life's been a mess
since the day I put you on.

237
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,416
Why'd I ever do it anyway?

238
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,208
I can't even keep a date
because of you.

239
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,250
Time to turn my life around.

240
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,333
Hello, world!

241
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,708
Goodbye, Spider-Man.

242
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,166
-[doorbell rings]
-Don't bother, Aunt May,

243
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,333
I got it.

244
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,333
Just because I take a picture
of Spider-Man

245
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,833
every now and then,

246
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,458
it doesn't mean
I know how to find him.

247
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,166
Anyway, I hear
he's fish chow now.

248
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,583
No corpus delicti,Parker.

249
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm betting he's still
spinning web somewhere.

250
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,833
Well, so find him, be my guest.

251
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,583
Parker I think he's been
framed.

252
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,625
Now this could be your chance
to help an innocent man.

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,833
Sorry, not my table.

254
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:31,458
Look, I don't talk this around
down at the station, but--

255
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,000
But what?

256
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,583
I've spent a lot of time
trying to figure out

257
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,083
who he is,
or what side he's on.

258
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,416
I don't know all the answers,

259
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,291
but I do know one thing.

260
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,416
He never turned his back
when he could help.

261
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,500
Which is just what
you're doing now.

262
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,583
All those times you were
taking pictures of him, Parker?
Hah.

263
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,708
Too bad none of his
character rubbed off.

264
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,458
[Parker thinking] She's right.

265
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,083
Spidey never did turn his back
when he was needed.

266
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,875
Except once.

267
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,875
[Parker thinking] Right
after I got my powers,

268
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,750
I figured I could earn
some quick bucks wrestling.

269
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,875
I made the costume so no one
would recognize me.

270
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:06,000
[audience cheering]

271
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,000
[man] Hey! Help!

272
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,000
Grab him!
Don't let him get away!

273
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:17,000
Hey, sorry, pal,
I'm a wrestler, not a cop.

274
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,875
Why should I get involved?

275
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:19,958
[indistinct dispatch
radio chatter]

276
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,291
[Peter thinking]
The police were at Aunt May's.

277
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,875
Someone had broken in.

278
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,833
Bad news for you, son.

279
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,958
[Peter thinking]
My Uncle Ben tried to stop him.

280
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,958
But the guy was armed.

281
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,333
The cop told me
the one who had did it

282
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,000
had been chased
to a warehouse.

283
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,833
And whoever it was,
I wanted him first.

284
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,083
And I got him, too.

285
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,708
It was the crook
from the arena.

286
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,208
The one I should have
stopped, but I didn't.

287
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,875
I had the power
and I didn't use it.

288
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:50,750
I lost my uncle
because I ignored
my responsibilities.

289
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,625
He always use to tell me,

290
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,500
"With great power,
comes great responsibility."

291
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,208
If I stop being Spider-Man,

292
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,625
-who else will suffer?
-[thud]

293
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,125
Going my way?

294
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,958
Well, this is driving me crazy.

295
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,708
You'd think I'd remember a guy
with a fishbowl for a head.

296
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,333
Probably wasn't born with it.

297
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,291
Just guessing though.

298
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,875
Wait a minute.

299
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,583
He said the bridge
was the place I ruined him.

300
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,625
Brooklyn Bridge.

301
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,958
Incidents involving Spider-Man.

302
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,375
Car accidents,
helicopter crash, robberies,

303
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,833
must be one of your hangouts.

304
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,333
A helicopter crash.

305
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,250
I remember.

306
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,125
A film crew were shooting
a car chase movie
on the bridge.

307
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,166
Let me call it up.

308
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:34,458
[Spider-Man] They were filming
a scene
with a sequential explosions.

309
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,583
But one of them
was too powerful
and it damaged a rotary.

310
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,208
There's more.
Right before the crash,

311
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,583
I thought I saw
something near the tower.

312
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,333
It was a mortar.

313
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,458
The special effects man
had hidden it up there,

314
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,166
without getting a permit.

315
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,875
He wanted an even
bigger explosion.

316
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,833
It was his fault
the copter went down,

317
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,416
And he'd have gotten
a way with it...

318
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,291
if I hadn't caught him.

319
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,458
[groaning]

320
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,000
They'll arrest me for this.

321
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,875
And it's all because of you!

322
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,625
I will get you, I swear.

323
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:11,833
[Lieutenant Lee]
This is something

324
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,000
