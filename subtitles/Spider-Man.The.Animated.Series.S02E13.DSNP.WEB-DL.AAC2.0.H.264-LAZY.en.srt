second-in-command.

163
00:08:56,583 --> 00:09:00,000
Mr. Toomes told me you were
intelligent, Miss Whitman.

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,583
He forgot to tell me
you were beautiful as well.

165
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,708
Why, thank you, Mr. Avis.

166
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,750
[Arthur]
Please, call me Arthur.

167
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,000
I hope I'll be seeing
a lot more of you,

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,958
and no offense,
a lot less of you.

169
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,625
What an arrogant,
egotistical...

170
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,833
[Peter]
You know what they say, Flash?

171
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,250
It takes one to know one.

172
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,208
Peter, what a surprise.

173
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,000
Are you here to see
what you're missing

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,958
by not being
Dr. Connor's assistant?

175
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,000
Hey, play your cards right
and maybe you can

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,291
wash Deb's test tubes.

177
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,416
Deb, I don't think
this place is safe.

178
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,875
Have you noticed anything

179
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,000
peculiar going on?
Anything weird?

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,291
Peter, you are weird
and you're obviously
a sore loser.

181
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,250
Now get out. Both of you.

182
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,416
-I've got work to do.
-No, but I am not with--

183
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,000
[Peter] Deborah, wait, I--

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,291
Now look what you've done,
flea brain.

185
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,708
Flash, I'm worried about her.

186
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,708
I think somebody here
has a hidden agenda.

187
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,583
Oh, it's that Avis geek.

188
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,583
Did you see the way
that he looked at her?

189
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,166
Wait, why didn't Deb tell him
to take a hike?

190
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,958
Uh, probably because she wanted
to make you feel as jealous

191
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,208
as you made her feel
at the award ceremony.

192
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,000
What?

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,458
You should have seen how she
looked at you and Felicia.

194
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,583
She did, really?

195
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,750
Ah, but well, if somebody
as brain pumped
as Debra Whitman

196
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,583
ever see in a jock like me?

197
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,875
Hey, she definitely
likes you, pal,

198
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,375
so she can't be that smart.

199
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,708
[Toomes] Are you enjoying
my life, Dr. Connors?

200
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:47,333
Oh, yes.
Well, I'm sorry...
I didn't see you there.

201
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,833
Thank you for meeting with me.

202
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,291
I've been anxious
to discuss our plans

203
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,708
for neogenic research.

204
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,708
Neogenics is my hope
for the future.

205
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,291
And of course, your legacy.

206
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,291
Don't rush me
to the grave so soon.

207
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,500
Norman Osborn
is making that mistake.

208
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,500
He dares to take my company
from me, but he will fail.

209
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,750
[coughing]

210
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,875
Mr. Toomes, are you OK?

211
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,333
I'm sorry, Doctor,
but my time is short,

212
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,708
and you were available
to me now.

213
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:22,458
A man of your soon-to-be
advanced years
must avoid shocks.

214
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,750
So this neural neutralizer
will keep you safely paralyzed.

215
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:33,750
Surely as a man of science,
you can appreciate my plan.

216
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,250
Look, see my
beautiful talons.

217
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,875
They are the end result
of a lost technology

218
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:42,000
deciphered from
the tablet of time.

219
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,583
Got yourself a real
bargain there. A real bargain.

220
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,375
[laughs]

221
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,708
These and my anti-gravity wings

222
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:01,875
are the best weapons.
I have to crush Osborn quickly.

223
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,208
The very advances he scoffed at

224
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,458
will destroy him.

225
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,583
But I agree that
your life energy

226
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,375
will only give me
30 minutes of youth.

227
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:15,625
Osborn will expected me
to attack him again,

228
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,833
but I have a better plan.

229
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,375
Thanks to my corporate spies,

230
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,583
I'm going to find
his son, Harry.

231
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,583
[Spider-Man thinking]
Well, there's Harry.

232
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,166
We all know why he's here.

233
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,708
The question is...

234
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,500
why was Mary Jane so eager
to have me show up?

235
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,291
As if I didn't have
enough to worry about

236
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,500
with his human buzzard
circling over my head.

237
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,083
Maybe she's in some
kind of trouble.

238
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,500
Nah, with my luck,

239
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,166
she's going to tell me that
she and Harry have
a big announcement to make.

240
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,250
Peter, look at this.

241
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,708
It's a letter from my dad.

242
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,958
Your dad?

243
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,000
But, Mary Jane, I thought
he abandoned your family
when you were just a...

244
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,333
A kid.
Yeah, can you believe it?

245
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,708
I don't see him for years,

246
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,750
and now out of the clear blue,

247
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,000
he wants me to meet him
this Wednesday night at 8:00.

248
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,458
Why are you telling me this?

249
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,125
I need somebody
to be with me

250
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,166
when I meet him
for the first time.

251
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,625
I want it to be you.

252
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,708
You've lost both your parents.

253
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,375
If anyone can understand
what I've been through,
it's you.

254
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,583
But what about Harry?

255
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,291
Harry and I...

256
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,708
[man] Five minutes everyone.
Five minutes.

257
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,416
We'll talk after the play.

258
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,625
It's Goethe's Faust.
Not a lot of laughs,

259
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,500
but you'll love the tunes.

260
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,375
[thinking]
How do you like that?

261
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,875
Maybe there is a chance
for us after all.

262
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,833
[Mary Jane] In all my life,

263
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:38,500
there's nothing has given
my heart so keen
a pang of loathing

264
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,125
as his repulsive face has done.

265
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:45,625
Nay, fear him not,
my sweetest one.

266
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,000
[crowd gasps]

267
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,333
[Peter thinking]
Not again.

268
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,375
This isn't how we rehearsed it.

269
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,583
Osborn!

270
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,625
[crowd screaming]

271
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,208
You are mine!

272
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,166
Ahhhh!

273
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,250
No, please!

274
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,333
[Spider-Man]
What is it,
you and the Osborns?

275
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,250
Are you trying to
start a collection?

276
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,208
Sorry, guy, you just pretend
you're the lead in Peter Pan.

277
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,458
-Whoa...
-Aah.

278
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:25,708
Oh, Harry!

279
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,166
[beeping]

280
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,291
No time to finish.

281
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,166
I guess he had a cake
in the oven.

282
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,208
Mary Jane!

283
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,250
Oh...

284
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,458
And I thought Foust
might be boring.

285
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,750
Harry...
I was so worried about you.

286
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,000
The story of my life.

287
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,750
Save the world, lose the girl.

288
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,583
-[ringing]
-[Peter] Peter Parker here,
please leave a message.

289
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,708
-[beeps]
-Parker, I just saw
some creepy giant bird

290
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,458
land on Toomes' penthouse.

291
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,333
Was this what you were
trying to ask me about?

292
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,833
Well, anyway, I thought
I'd give you the story

293
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,458
before I call the cops.

294
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,208
Get over here
and bring your camera.

295
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,458
[screams]

296
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,291
Get over here
and bring you camera.

297
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,875
[screams]

298
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:41,875
Debra.

299
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,125
I should have stayed here
and kept an eye on her.

300
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,583
If anything's happened...
Huh?

301
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,958
Thompson,
what are you doing here?

302
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,083
Spider-Man. I was only looking
for someone. See?

303
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,000
For me? You shouldn't have.

304
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,708
No! For a girl
named Debra Whitman
who works in this place.

305
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,958
She didn't show up
for our tutoring session,

306
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,583
and now I find you here.

307
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,833
Something's gotta be wrong.
We have to find her.

308
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,125
-We?
-Yeah. You and me.

309
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,166
We make a heck of a team.

310
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,208
Remember when we faced
the spider-slayers together
and--

311
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,583
Flash, I remember, go home.

312
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,000
All right, you can count on me.

313
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,458
Good.

314
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,000
You can count on me
to be like you

315
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and save the people
that I care about.

316
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,333
[Spider-Man] Debra?

317
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,458
Stop!

318
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,250
Great! I'm trapped
in a gigantic video game.

319
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,875
At least I don't need

Hooked into the gun,

Toomes isn't messing around
when it comes to security.

00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,375
Let's see, if I use a little
geometry to my advantage.

324
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,083
Have to get the angles
just right.

That disc, I remember
reading theoretical papers

331

I think they called it
a neural neutralizer.

What did he do to me?

There's no time to explain.
Just get out of here.

I've activated
