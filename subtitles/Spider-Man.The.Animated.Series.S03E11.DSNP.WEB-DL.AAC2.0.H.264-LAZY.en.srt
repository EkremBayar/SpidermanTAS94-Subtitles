-[Ashley] You used
the word "freaks."

167

These are human beings
who have an illness.

168
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:34,125
You make it sound like
they have the flu, Dr. Kafka.

169
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,250
These monsters must be stopped!

[snarling]

171
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,208
And you know who's
at the bottom of all this?

172
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,208
Spider-Man.

173
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,250
He's the one who's attracting
this trouble and has-- Huh?!

174
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,875
[snarls]

175
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,416
Why, if it isn't our old boss.

176
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,083
-[Jonah groans]
-Perfect appetizer.

177
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,458
Ah, and here's the main course.

178
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,208
This is what we call service.

179
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,625
No! Eddie!

180
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,208
-You?!
-Eddie, listen to me.

181
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,083
It's the symbiote
that compels you to violence.

182
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,458
You must fight its influence.

183
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,833
Yeah, Brock,
d-d-d-don't hurt me.

184
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,500
I've always thought
the world of you.

185
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,000
[snarls]

186
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,291
-Stay away from him, Kafka.
-Eddie.

187
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,291
Venom's appearance here
caught me off guard.

188
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,750
[grunts]

189
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,708
But Dr. Kafka's
bought me some time.

190
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,833
You see, you are strong enough.

191
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,166
You can reject it.

192
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,750
No, Ashley.

193
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,875
Our other is too strong!

194
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,458
Spider-Man!

[groans]

199
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,333
Goodbye.

200
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,458
[Ashley] Eddie, no!

201
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,000
If you destroy Spider-Man,

202
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,625
the alien will take
over completely.

203
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,625

[screams]

00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,750
Ohh! Can't afford
to lose him again.

206
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,875
[growls]
You were going to follow us?

207
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,583
What made you think
you'd live long enough?

[Iron Man]
That was for War Machine.

211
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,708
This is for me.

00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,375
[groans]

213
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,500
My head, it's on fire!

214
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,000
Eddie, no!

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,083
Help me!

216
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,583
Fight the symbiote.

217
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,458
-Shut up!
-Aaah!

[growling]

219
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,166
I owe you one, Iron Man.

220
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,875
-Thanks.
-Don't mention it.

221
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,708
Any friend of War Machine's
is a friend of mine.

222
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,458
Come on, let's see
if we can catch him!

223
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,708
This is taking forever!

224
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,500
I got people to torment.

225
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,875
Transfer is almost complete.

226
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,583
And then we can
say hello to hothead?

227
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,083
I mean, Dormammu?

228
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,208
The urn is not yet full.

229
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:56,333
We need the energy
of a few more lives.

230
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,166
Only a few? Too bad.

231
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,083
[Carnage cackling]

232
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,458
Where are they?

233
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,416
Maybe Madame Web would know,

234
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:11,166
except that weird old crone's
never around when you-- Hey!

235
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,375
Old crone, am I?

236
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,000
[Spider-Man] Look, I
don't have time to talk.

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,625
I've got to help Iron Man
find Venom and Carnage.

238
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,333
Hold your tongue and watch.

239
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:26,083
You see,
time has already passed.

240
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,166
Wh-- Where am I?

241
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,458
Ravencroft?

242
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,875
We-- No, Ibrought you back.

243
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,833
You were right about my other.

244
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,583
When I spared Spider-Man,

245
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,958
the symbiote,
it nearly tore apart my mind.

246
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,708
Right now,
it sees you as a threat.

247
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,708
No, but I can't!

248
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,416
Keep watching.

249
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:50,375
I can't imagine how you
must be suffering, Eddie.

250
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,333
I can stand it.
I can stand it for you.

251
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:57,458
Ashley, I know you could
never love a monster like me.

252
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,250
But I could love the man.

253
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,833
We must separate you
from the symbiote

254
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,625
-before it's too late.
-[groans]

255
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,708
No!

256
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,583
Fight it, Eddie.
You must!

257
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:09,000
Ahh!
The alien is getting stronger!

258
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,458
Then we mustn't waste time.

259
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,875
I have an associate
who can help us.

260
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,000
[Spider-Man]
Where are they going?

261
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,458
- Maybe I can--
- Be quiet.

262
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:22,458
You can keep watching.

263
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,000
I conducted tests
on this piece of the symbiote

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,583
I got from Spider-Man
a few months ago,

265
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,166
and I've learned
that a combination
of high-range sonics

266
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,500
and infrared heat
might separate you

267
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,416
from the alien organism.

268
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,166
I'll take any chance
to be human again!

269
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:41,083
[Madame Web] And now,
time passes again.

270
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,875
[Spider-Man] How do you do this?

271
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,000
[Madame Web]
Transcend time and space?

272
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,333
It's simple, I practice.

00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,125
Aaah!

276
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,875
We can hold it in
this containment unit.

277
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,416
Sporadic sound pulses
will keep it dormant.

278
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,458
Are we, am I--

279
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:07,458
Yes, you're Eddie again,
and only Eddie.

280
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,166
[Spider-Man]
That's one less symbiote

281
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,416
I have to worry about,
but what about Carnage?

282
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,833
Silence.

283
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,750
[Spider-Man] It's Kasady.

284
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,416
Where is he?

285
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,708
He's waiting for
a mutual acquaintance of yours,

286
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,708
a strong woman.

287
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,833
-Who?
-Remember this:

288
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,333
You must
keep your friends close

289
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:35,166
and your enemies even closer.

290

[Spider-Man] Wait, what's
that supposed to mean?

291
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,958
She said Carnage was waiting
for a mutual acquaintance,

292
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,375
but who does he
know that I know?

293
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,291
Oh, no!
There is one person.

294

Good evening, Detective Lee.

00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:53,583

My, aren't we inhospitable?

[Spider-Man] I'll show you
inhospitable.

Ashley, where are you going?

Kasady's just been spotted
near Columbus Circle.

You're not thinking
of going there, are you?

Kasady's also my patient, Curt.

313
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,750
I took an oath.

314

At least, let me go with--
