For many years in
the spy underworld

00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:37,125
there was a rumor of
a doomsday device,

A device left by German
spies in New York City

but with the reappearance

I realized that the
stories could be true

243
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:56,416
and the weapon might
still be intact.

244
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,416
The device had been created
by a German master-spy.

The Red Skull.
