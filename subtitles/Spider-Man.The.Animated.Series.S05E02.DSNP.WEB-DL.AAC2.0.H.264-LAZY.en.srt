you can't sell this house.

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,458
I just can't believe
that this nightmare

164
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,333
is starting all over again.

Oh! [sobbing]

Now what's he up to?

I'm gonna find out
just who this guy really is.

Huh?!

This looks interesting.

00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,708
I've been here before.

173
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,500
What's his connection
to this place?

174
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,583
None of this makes any sense!

175
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,166
I'm glad they haven't changed
their ventilation system

176

May Parker won't talk,

178

but I won't leave
until she does.

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,125
Frustrating isn't it,
when somebody won't tell you

180
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,583
all that they know?

181
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,583
Nick, I know you
want all the details,

182
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,333
but some things have to be
kept secret even from you.

183
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,708
Fine. My job is to make sure
that no matter what,

184
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,833
Richard and Mary Parker's name
must not be cleared.

185
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,708
The official line
is that they died

as Russian counterspies,
traitors!

Is Fury conspiring to smear
my parents' reputation?

Why haven't
I ever seen this before?

Because if you had,
you would know

that your parents
were spies for Russia.

Peter, I knew your parents also.

They were American operatives,

282
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,291
and they were
considered the best.

283

I know
because I was one as well.

You? A secret agent?

285
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,166
Yes. Your parents were
on a mission to find the truth

286
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,458
about a secret doomsday weapon

287
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,708
that was supposedly built
to destroy America.

288
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,250
It had been
an old World War II project

289
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,083
that the Germans initiated.

290
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:19,333
Rumor had it it was created
by a Dr. Wolfgang Groitzig.

291
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,750
But for some reason,
it was never used.

292
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,375
This doomsday device
was thought to be a hoax

293
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,125
until the late 1970s.

294
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,708
Your parents stumbled
onto Groitzig living

295
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:34,625
somewhere in Moscow, or so they
told the U.S. government.

296
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,625
So, they were sent to Russia.

297
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:40,166
But once there, they announced
that they were double agents,

298
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,708
working for the USSR all along.

299
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,375
Then, suddenly, there in Russia,

300
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,875
your parents died
in a plane crash.

301
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:51,583
Our government had to conclude
that Groitzig wasn't alive.

302
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,333
That Richard and Mary had lied

303
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,333
to hide their real reason
for being on Soviet soil.

304
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,708
But with Groitzig's discovery
and kidnapping,

305
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,166
well, no one knows
what to believe.

-Are you okay?
-No, I'm angry!

307

I wanna go to Russia
and find out about Groitzig!

308
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,958
Tonight, I overheard
a man named Nick Fury

309
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,250
hint that my parents
might not be traitors.

310
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,083
Somebody is lying.

311
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:20,125
If that's true, you have
to get to the bottom of this.

MJ, I love you.

313

If I don't resolve this mess,
I'll go crazy.

to pay for a trip to Russia?

Why would he do
a crazy thing like--

You always said
he was a menace to the world.

What if you were right?

What if he's decided
to take himself global?

Wait a minute,

Of course.

Their government is in turmoil.

328
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,875
You don't suppose
he's going to try

329
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,416
to get them to elect him
their leader?

330
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,875
What if he became
a world power unto himself?

331
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,833
This is a disaster!

America has to know,
Mr. Jameson.

333
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,458
You have to send me
over there to take pictures.

334
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,583
You don't believe
a word of this, right?

335
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:16,333
No. In this case, I think
Peter's fears are valid.

And if you send Peter to Russia,

All right. You two go.

But, Parker, if you
don't bring back a story,

I'll have you shipped

Just a friend.
Excuse me, Peter.

Well, Mr. Robertson,

Fine with me.

Robbie was right.

00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,958
I should get some sleep

in the morning.

Hey, it's Robbie.

out at this hour?

[gasps] Quickly, come inside.
Come, come.
