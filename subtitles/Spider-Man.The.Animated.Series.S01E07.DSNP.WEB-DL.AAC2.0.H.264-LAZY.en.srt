He's descended from

He was a big game

When hunting was outlawed

a miracle drug.

burned in his blood.

163
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,875
or jungles involved.

164
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,333
Bye, Peter.

165
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,833
At least I hope not.

166
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,291
If I missed her, I put on
this monkey suit for nothing.

167
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,250
Peter, I'm so glad you made it,

168
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,000
and you look great.

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,958
[Man] One minute warning,
Mary Jane.

170
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,125
Okay.

171
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,125
I'm sorry, Peter, I have to go.

172
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,708
Let's skip the party afterwards
and get a bite to eat,

173
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,583
just you and me, alone.

174
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,875
Really?

175
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,625
Uh, great.

176
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,375
[Announcer] Here
comes our next model.

177
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,958
It's Miss Mary Jane Watson.

178
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,583
[upbeat music]

179
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,333
A theater student at ESU,
Mary Jane looks stunning

180
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,000
in this faux
leopard skin print.

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,291
Wow, that outfit brings
out the animal in me.

182
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,625
[Announcer] And now,
here we have Katrina

183
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,166
in a fantastic zebra design.

184
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,375
[Woman] Look, it's
the guy from cats!

185
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,875
[gasping]

186
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,500
[sniffing]

187
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,708
Spider-Man.

188
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,833
Huh, Felicia Hardy?

189
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,500
Parker,
what are you doing here?

190
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,166
My aunt gave me her invitation.

191
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,583
What are you doing here?

192
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,458
This is
a Hardy Foundation event.

193
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,000
Mother's the chairperson,
and I'm helping her.

194
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,208
This is a wonderful surprise.

195
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,375
You can take me to
the party later.

196
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,000
Yeah, but...

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,708
We'll talk. I've got to run.

198
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,708
I'm supposed to go out with
Mary Jane after the show.

199
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,166
[gasping]

200
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,000
[Peter] Kraven,
he must have my scent!

201
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,708
Parker? Why is he--

202
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,458
Leaving?

203
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,750
There he goes with that
disappearing act again.

204
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,000
[scoffs]

205
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,875
-Back off!
-[Woman] What are you doing?

206
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:04,875
Spider-Man, I know you are
here. Stop hiding from me!

207
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,833
What a great show!

208
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,958
These foundation events
are usually stale.

209
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,625
[Spider-Man]
Yo, Jungle Jim, up here.

210
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,083
[crowd gasping]

211
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,291
[audience applauding]

212
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,125
[Kraven] Where is my woman?

213
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,458
[Spider-Man] You're the hunter,
can't you find her?

214
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,000
Whoa!

215
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,583
Mariah!

216
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,416
If I go, so does your comrade.

217
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,875
[Spider-Man] My comrade?

218
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,708
Jungle freak, if
you hurt Robbie!

219
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:51,250
You have six hours
to save your friend.

220
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,458
Bring me Mariah!

221
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,125
[chuckles] She'll know
how to find me,

222
00:11:56,125 --> 00:12:00,875
and don't
underestimate me again.

223
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,000
[laughing]

224
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,750
[Spider-Man] He's
kidnapped Robbie,

225
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,875
and it's all my fault,
my fault.

226
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,250
[answering machine beeping]

227
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,083
[J.J.] Robbie, where
the heck are you?

228
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,250
The airline says your
plane landed hours ago.

229
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,708
What happened to you?

230
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,333
[Spider-Man] How
does "I was kidnapped

231
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,250
by a crazed big-game
hunter" grab you, J.J?

232
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,833
Robbie's one of the people I
respect the most.

233
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,000
When will I learn to keep
my friends out of my fights?

234
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,416
Now I have to find
him and the doctor,

235
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,125
but where do I start?

236
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,458
[phone dialing]

237
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,000
Hello, Paula?

238
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,958
I need to use your lab.
Great, great.

239
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,375
I'll see you in an hour.
I'll explain when I get there.

240
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,625
[lion moaning]

241
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,000
Would you like some water?

242
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,291
[panting]
Why are you doing this?

243
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,375
I was raised in the traditions
of nobility,

244
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,708
and now I live in
the world of the jungle.

245
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:30,958
The codes of conduct that
govern both are very similar.

246
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,583
If you take what
belongs to another,

247
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,375
there must be retribution.

248
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,291
I don't know what
you're talking about,

249
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,958
this isn't the jungle!

250
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,125
It's a concrete jungle,
the same rules apply.

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,833
[Spider-Man]
I'm running low on time,

252
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,583
and on labs.

253
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,083
Come on, doc, where are you?

[bus door hissing open]

255
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,583
No, I'm doing this all wrong.

256
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,583
I'm letting Kraven
call the shots.

257
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,625
Maybe I should be
looking for him instead.

258
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,083
That's it!

259
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,333
I must hunt the hunter,
but where?

260
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,291
Kraven is who I am.
I belong among the animals.

261
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,208
[Spider-Man] Of course!

262
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,583
[rats screeching]

[monitor beeping]

264

The African Jungle Exhibit.
Oh, this is almost too obvious.

265
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:07,000
Robbie's the bait.
Okay, I'll bite.

266

Welcome to my jungle.

[Spider-Man] Misfire!

[Kraven] Where's Mariah?

00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,458
[Spider-Man] I don't know.

277
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,083
Look, can't we talk this
over like civilized men?

278
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:51,208
Nyet.Your friend is lost.

279
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,458
[Spider-Man] Kraven,
let Robbie go.

280
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,458
Leave him out of
this, he's innocent!

281
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,458
We had a deal, and
your time is up!

282
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,458
[Spider-Man] Oh!

283
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:22,375
Your smoke screen's
no match for my spider sense.

284
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,291
You're nothing but an animal!

285
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,416
I know evil and good,

[Spider-Man] Quoting
Solzhenitsyn doesn't
make you human.

Have to do this the hard way.

00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,708
Not bad for a guy
with a busted web shooter, huh?

301
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,000
Boy, I'm sure glad
you showed up.

302

[Spider-Man] I'm sorry I put
you in such danger, my friend.

I feel so strange.

That's the antidote
taking effect, Sergei.

You're becoming once
more the man I love.

for your thoughts.

Will you please just tell
me what's going on here?

How did I get involved?

00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,500
[Spider-Man] I guess you
have me to thank for that.

[ship's siren blowing]

is finally over.

00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,125
I feel like I'm trapped in
a Danielle Steele novel.

325
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,708
Correct me if I'm wrong but,

326
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,750
isn't the hero supposed
to get the girl?

327
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,625
I saved the city
from jungle boy,

328
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,500
and I'll be lucky if
Mary Jane or Felicia

329
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,958
ever speak to me again.

330
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,708
Not to mention the fact

331
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,500
that the animal kingdom
walked all over my costume.

332
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Never again do I get in
the middle of a lovers' spat.

333
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,583
Stick a fork in me, I'm done.

334
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,208
