168
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,208
Ah, Jay Three Communications.

169
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,583
Just what I need to let the
world know of my arrival.

170
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,208
[gasping]

171
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,125
[intense music playing]

172
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,750
[Electro]
People of Earth, rejoice.

173
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,000
For a new age is upon you.

174
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,458
The age of Electro.

175
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,500
No force can withstand me.

176
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,875
No living thing can
exist without my energy.

177
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:44,625
I have willed the cessation
of all ground vehicles

178
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:48,250
in New York City as
a small demonstration

179
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,125
of what I can do.

180
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,833
This is only the tiniest
sample of my abilities.

181
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,250
I don't really control power.

182
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,125
I am power.

183
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,000
Our first task will be to
find out where they fled to.

184
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,833
We must find Electro.

185
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,708
Hey, my TV.

186
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,708
It just switched itself on.

187
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:13,583
All who oppose me
shall be destroyed.

188
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:14,708
I think we just found him.

189
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,458
Incredible, it's a miniature

190
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,708
transportable imaging device.

191
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,333
You United Nations delegates

192
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,166
are hereby instructed
to rectify

193
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:27,750
a declaration giving
me complete control

194
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,416
of all governments, citizens,

195
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,958
and property to
use as I see fit.

196
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,250
Submit now so I need not take

197
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,458
what is rightfully
mine by force.

198
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,458
I've got to get down there.

199
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,750
Peter's probably in
the thick of all this.

200
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,583
You can't put your
life in danger

201
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,583
just because of Peter's
disregard for his own safety.

202
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,000
Listen, Aunt Anna.
You're wrong.

203
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,750
Peter stands for everything
that's good in the world.

204
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,958
Well, it's just that
I love you so much.

205
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,333
Then that's something
you share with Peter.

206
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,458
He loves me too.

207
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,958
Any leaders who oppose
this oath of obedience

208
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,250
will be considered
traitors to the Earth

209
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,625
and will be
so merrily executed.

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,291
Huh?

211
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,708
[gasps]

212
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,875
[groaning]

213
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,708
Keep it up.
He's being distracted.

214
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,875
[mumbling]

215
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:31,833
[gasps]

216
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,875
Peter!

217
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
[groaning]

218
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,000
No! [screams]

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,208
Mary Jane!

220
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,000
[laughs]

221
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,708
Auf Wiedersehen,Spider-Man.

222
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,250
[groans]

223
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,375
You again?

224
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,875
It's time I showed the world

225
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,375
how futile your efforts are.

226
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,875
[laughs]

227
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:29,833
What have I done?

228
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,250
She's weak, Spider-Man.

229
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,583
We'd better get
her to a safe place

230
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,875
where she can rest.

231
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,416
It's my fault.

232
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,125
If she weren't married to me,

233
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,250
she never would've
been on that roof.

234
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,125
If I weren't playing hero--

235
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,583
[Captain America] I gather
that she's important to you.

236
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,291
But remember,
you're also important.

237
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,875
A lot of people are
counting on you.

238
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,583
People just like her.

239
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,291
I know you want to go with her.

240
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,708
If you do, she may not
have a world to wake up to.

241
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,083
That's the price you pay
when you do this job.

242
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,333
All right,
let's go stop that maniac.

243
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,125
[crumbling]

244
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,708
[Electro] Come, my friends.

245
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,958
[whirring]

246
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,416
I need to make a
memorable entrance.

247
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,583
[intense music playing]

248
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,708
[clapping]

249
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,000
The time has come.

250
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,833
Submission or oblivion.

251
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,083
The choice is yours.

252
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,583
He's 1000 times more
powerful than we thought.

253
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,083
And growing.

254
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,458
What hope do we have
of stopping him now?

255
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,083
I've spent the last 50 years

256
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,625
with the Red Skull's
hands at my throat.

257
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,375
I know how he thinks.

258
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,500
That mad man would
never allow someone

259
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,208
to be more powerful than he is.

260
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,833
The Red Skull must've prepared

261
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,458
some kind of fail safe device.

262
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,000
Some way to control him.

263
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But what could be more
powerful than Electro,

264
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,958
the ultimate weapon?

265
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,583
The vortex.

266
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,000
The energy field that
kept Cap suspended in time

267
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,875
is self-perpetuating energy.

268
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,458
It's completely autonomous

269
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,458
from the Earth's
electromagnetic fields.

270
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,166
I get it.

271
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,833
The Red Skull must've
created the vortex

272
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,416
as a trump card.

273
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,125
Something to
threaten Electro with

274
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,125
if Electro got out of hand.

275
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,208
The rest of you, hightail it
over to the United Nations

276
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,833
and protect the delegates.

277
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,291
Spider-Man and I will
go after the vortex.

278
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,416
Let's move!

279
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,583
We've got to try to
keep Electro busy

280
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,125
until the Army arrives.

281
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,291
Not the Army.

282
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,708
This is just the kind of thing

283
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,458
S.H.I.E.L.D was designed for.

284
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,416
Well, what are we waiting for?

285
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,958
Invitations?

286
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:42,958
Ah, I sense Earth's mighty
heroes have arrived.

287
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,625
50 years too late.

288
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,708
My robots will keep
them duly occupied.

289
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,458
Now, let us get
back to the business

290
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,875
of electing me
ruler of the Earth.

291
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,208
[intense music playing]

292
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,583
What is that thing?

293
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,000
[man] It's S.H.I.E.L.D.

294
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,166
S.H.I.E.L.D Headquarters
in plain sight

295
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,708
of the whole city?

296
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,416
Preston must really be
taking this seriously.

297
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,750
Electro, we demand your
immediate surrender.

298
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,875
[intense music playing]

299
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,583
Signal the attack.

300
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,458
Attack hovercraft, move in.

301
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,291
Out on omega, delta.

302
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,583

[intense music playing]

306
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,708
Our fighters are dropping out
of the sky like hailstones.

307
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,125
Revert to emergency
attack plan 814.

308
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,125
[intense music playing]

309
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,458
Use the motherships weapons.

310
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,750
Carrier turrets one,
three, and five.

311
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,583
Target only Electro.

312
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,833
Fire!

313
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,875
Colonel Fury, I think
we've stopped him.

314
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,583
Nice try.

315
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,708
Now, it's my turn.

316
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:47,833
Brace for attack.

317
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,708
No!

318
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,833
Ship weapons won't respond.

319
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,708
Hurry, Electro is
shutting us down.

320
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,000
S.H.I.E.L.D is going dead.

321
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,875
[intense music playing]

322
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,958
Deploy the emergency power.

323
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,416
Sir, there isn't
any emergency power.

324
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,416
Get everyone out.
Abandon ship.

325
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,375
-Sir, I--
-Agent, that's an order.

326
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,458
Now, beat it.

[Agent] Colonel Fury,
are you all right?

330
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,458
Do you copy?

331
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,708
Yeah, I'm still alive.

332
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,166

The vortex is a

Its energy is
self-perpetuating, like a loop.
