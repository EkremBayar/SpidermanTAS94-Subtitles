00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,333
Ben!

167
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,166
-You're--
-Normal again?

168
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,875
Thanks for noticing.

169
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:32,083
Old Doc D. changed me back
just like I always wanted.

170
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,583
How did he do that?

171
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:37,291
Doc's some sort of
power separator.

172
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:41,416
Watch this, I can transform
whenever I want to.

173
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,125
Pretty neat, huh?

174
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,000
Maybe. What does he want
from you in return?

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,083
Nothing, other than
for him to be happy.

176
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,208
That's what I want
for all my citizenry.

177
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,083
Then why don't you free
them from your tyranny?

178
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,583
Why don't you leave
them as they were

179
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,250
before you arrived from Earth?

180
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,208
Because it wouldn't be
long before they'd be

181
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:03,333
swallowed up by someone like
Octavius, or The Red Skull.

182
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:07,333
I am not a tyrant,
I am their savior.

183
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:11,458
Look around you,
everyone here is free.

184
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:15,708
I've been able to
establish an ideal society.

185
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,583
There is no back-breaking labor,

186
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:21,875
no struggle for food and
shelter, only pleasure.

187
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,833
And I owe it all to
my miraculous robots.

188
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,000
This technology does
nothing but good.

189
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,875
Look what it has done for
Ben Grimm, or even for myself.

190
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,708
The horrible acid burns
that ruined your face,

191
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,833
-they're gone.
-Yes.

192
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:40,708
A lab accident once turned me
into monster, like Ben here.

193
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:44,166
But now, I am as
pleasing to look at

194
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,708
as my benevolence is to behold.

195
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:51,708
I desire nothing but to keep
my citizens content and happy.

196
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,875
You desire nothing but
their praise and servitude.

197
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,125
You're a charlatan.

198
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,000
Hey, now that ain't fair, Reed.

199
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,708
I think I can guess why
you're attacking me, Richards.

200
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:06,708
I've cured Ben,
something you could never do.

201
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:07,833
Why, you--

Doc!

208
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,875
You guys don't understand.

209
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,208
I owe Doc Doom too much!

210
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,583
Since you won't
accept my sincerity,

211
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:37,583
or my hospitality, you will
all be bound over for trial.

212
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,375
The charge is treason
against New Latveria,

213
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:45,333
and if found guilty,
you will all be destroyed!

214
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,458
[laughing]

215
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,958
See what I told
you about Richards?

216
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,875
Oh, Reed will calm down.

217
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,250
Then you can release them all.

218
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,833
Can I?

219
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,958
I will not let them
destroy the New Latveria

220
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,333
I've built here.

221
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,125
Do you want all
this to be ruined?

222
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:08,708
No, Doc, but, trust me,
you can let 'em go.

223
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,833
Why should I trust you when
you don't trust me enough

224
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:17,708
to tell me how and why
we were brought here?

225
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:21,833
Okay, but you've gotta
promise to free my friends.

226
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:22,958
Of course I will.

227
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,500
You have my word.

228
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,625
That's good enough for me.

229
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:31,875
Spider-Man told us that
some guy called The Beyonder

230
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,708
used some high-tech
transporter machine

231
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,458
to bring us all here.

232
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,958
He wants to play
a game with the good guys

233
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,583
and the bad guys
to see who's gonna win.

234
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,250
A-ha.

235
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,000
I knew there was a higher
power involved in this.

236
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,416
When I was being brought
here across the galaxy,

237
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:51,083
I used the instruments
in my suit to get a fix

238
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,375
on the source of the
dimensional disturbance.

239
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,500
I traced the coordinates
to an asteroid

240
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,708
that was in orbit
around this planet,

241
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,708
but I had no means
of getting there.

242
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:03,208
Now, Ben, you tell me of
a space-time transporter.

243
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,833
You must take me to
see it, you must!

244
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,458
Well, well,
I would have never guessed

245
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:13,083
a lab would be here in
this worm-filled wasteland.

My robot will occupy them
with some obedience training.

248
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,208
[Ben] Spidey says
this is the machine

249
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,416
that brought us here.

250
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,625
[Dr. Doom] It is beautiful.

251
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,875
You mean, you can maybe
get us outta here?

252
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,833
That, and maybe more.

253

[controls beeping]

00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,416
There, it is done.

255
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:42,583
And now, to put my
plan into action.

256
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,625
Wait, Doc!

257
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,875
Where you going?

258
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,375

260
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,875
What'd you do?

261
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,625
How'd we get back here?

262
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,500
I have willed us here, Ben.

263
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,083
Don't you see?

264
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,583
My elemental splitter not
only separates elements,

265
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,625
it can also be
used to fuse them.

266
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:22,458
I used it to combine the
Beyonder's powers with my own.

267
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,750
Imagine the possibilities.

268
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,166
With these new powers, my
very thoughts become reality.

269
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:36,291
The first thing I will do
is end this destructive

270
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,583
and unnecessary
war on my planet.

[Captain America] At last,

I have you where
I've always wanted.

00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,208
Huh?

[Black Cat] What's
happening to them?

275

Now, let's deal with
the rest of my guests.

276
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,708
Okay, that was a pretty
neat trick, Doom.

277
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,375
Explain how you did it.

278
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,625
I have taken over the
powers of The Beyonder.

279
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,875
I have sent the
evil-doers back to Earth.

280
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:11,000
You are all now my guests
here on New Latveria.

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,583
My desire is that you should
live amongst my subjects.

282
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:19,333
Tell them what a great and
benevolent leader I am.

283
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,458
Hold on, Doom,
we're not your pawns.

284
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,166
Under that metal suit,
you're just a very disturbed

286
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,708
You can't possibly control
the god-like abilities

287
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,250
you've stolen.

288
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,708
You might place us
all in grave danger

289
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,333
if you don't give that power up.

290
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,875
Do you take me for a fool?

291
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,750
Who amongst you has ever wanted

292
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,583
to give up their super powers?

293
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,458
I have, because I've learned

294
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,208
time and time again,
that with great power,

295
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,708
there must also come
great responsibility.

296
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,875
And that's a responsibility
even you can't avoid.

297
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,458
I do not wish to avoid it.

298
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,416
This power,
this responsibility,

299
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,750
is my destiny.

300
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,458
Ah, I grow weary of this
exercise in futility.

301

not be dominated.

I would not harm you.

305
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,000
I have kept my word.

[dramatic music playing]

307

We're over 50 miles away.

308
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,708
So how do we fight him?

309
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,416
There's no way we can overcome
the powers he has now.

310
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,875
We have to find a way.

311
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,416
Don't you see?

312
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,708
The Beyonder still
exists inside of Doom,

313
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,250
And I think he still wants
to see who backs down first.

314
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,000
Good, or evil.

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,500
I agree with Spider-Man.

316
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,083
I say we vote on whether
to oppose Doom or not.

317
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,833
I vote we fight.

318
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,333
An excellent idea.

319
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,083
Yes, fight!

320
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,458
You realize Doom is
probably reading our minds.

321
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,250
If we vote to oppose him,
he may immediately

322
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,000
decide to retaliate.

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,583
What's he gonna do, drop a
mountain on us or something?

Perhaps they are
