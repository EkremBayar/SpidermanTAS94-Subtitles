Ah, nice to just get

Clears out the cobwebs.

Oh. Spidey sense
is going crazy!

16
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,125
A guy can't even sling a
few webs in peace any more!

17
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:31,750
Flying toys, now why would they
alert my Spider sense?

18
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,708
Oh! Well, ask a
bone-head question.

19
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:41,708
[male voice] Amazing!
His speed, his agility.

20
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,750
They're a regular

Flying smart bombs!

Hold that pose.

24
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,000
All right,
don't hold that pose.

25

If you're gonna
be temperamental,

26

I'll fix it so you never
work in this town again.

27

or they'll blow me to bits!

29
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,458
They split up,
trying to box me in.

30
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,458
Maybe I can use
that against them.

31
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,708
I have to time this
just right.

32
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:26,958
Here comes the other one.

33
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,375
Last one and I'm home free.

34
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,333
And who is on my tail
this time?

35
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,625
You blew it, you failed,
Smythe!

36
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,291
My father is the
world's foremost expert

37
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,208
in the field of
robotics, Mr. Osborn.

38
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,958
He is not a failure.

39
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,458
Relax, Alistair,
no need to defend me.

40
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,000
No need?

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,750
You let that web-slinging
weasel make fools of us.

42
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,458
Not for long, this
was a only a trial run.

43
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,291
The spider seekers
have proven that

44
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,166
my targeting computers
can find Spider-Man.

45
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,458
They're my targeting computers!

46
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,458
I put up the money,
you only invented them.

47
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,208
Good only if they can
catch him.

48
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,083
That's not their job.

49
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,333
Then whose job is it?

50
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,125
That's whose job it is.

51
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,708
Gentlemen, I give you my
Spider Slayer, The Black Widow.

52
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,375
[woman] Then there's
the theater room

53
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,333
the parking attendants,
the musicians,

54
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,708
the cleaning crew, it's
all been taken care of,

55
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,000
right, Mr. Jameson?

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,583
Of course,
this isn't the first

57
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,000
charity ball I've
hosted, Miss Hardy.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes, but this is the first one

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,583
with the Hardy name
attached to it.

60
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,375
Now, what about
the photographer?

61
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,000
Mother says we
absolutely must have one.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,583
Yeah, well, tell
mother that if I spend

63
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,625
any more money on this thing,
I'm going to need charity.

64
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,166
Jonah, remember that
Felicia's mother

65
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:57,083
is an important
philanthropist and advertiser.

66
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,333
Besides, we know
of a photographer.

67
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,208
You don't mean?

68
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,875
[Peter] Just great, this
is all I need in my life,

69
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,000
flying robots.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,375
Wonder who's controlling--

71
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,125
Peter, Mr. Jameson
wants to see you.

72
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,250
Be right there.

73
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,000
I assure you Miss Hardy,
this charity ball

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,208
is just as important
to me as it is to you.

75
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:21,708
That's why I'm sending my
very best photographer.

76
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,708
Hmm, who might that be?

77
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,333
[Peter] Felicia Hardy!

78
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,000
Peter Parker?

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,250
You know him?

80
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,875
We go to college together.

81
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,583
Parker, you're just as
unpredictable as ever.

82
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,875
Mr. Jameson says you're
his best photographer.

83
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,208
He does?

84
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,750
My very best.

85
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,000
You point, you
shoot, no big deal.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well this charity thing
is a big deal, Parker.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,750
Miss Hardy's mother
is sponsoring it,

88
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,208
and I'm hosting it, think
you can take pictures of

89
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,583
something other than
Spider-Man for a change?

90
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,333
Call me Mr. Versatile.

91
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,583
I'm sure you won't
disappoint me.

92
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,625
No way.

93
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,458
See you there then.

94
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,291
Robbie, see if you
can find Eddie Brock.

95
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,875
He's supposed to have some
big scoop for me, and I--

96
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,000
Parker, your mouth's open.

97
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,583
[sizzles]

98
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,958
[man] Not too close, Osborn.

99
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,500
That acid's the only thing

100
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,125
that can penetrate the
Black Widow's armor.

101
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,750
We're almost ready.

102
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,583
Yeah, almost,
Eddie Brock's biggest
scoop. [chuckles]

103
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,833
The capture of Spider-Man!

104
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,166
You will not regret bringing
me in on this, Mr. Smythe.

105
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,500
Your insurance, Brock,
is immediate here.

106
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,750
Everything will be done
on the up and up.

107
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,000
Wouldn't want things getting
out of hand, would we?

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,583
I don't intend to play
judge and jury, Spencer.

109
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,333
I just want
Spider-Man captured.
He's a criminal!

110
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,375
Yeah, and he's big news, too.

111
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,750
I gotta go line up
my crew, see you.

112
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,583
I have to leave also, but
I want to reassure you,

113
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,291
everything will be done
strictly by the book.

114
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,416
You have to trust me.

115
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,708
I get a bad feeling
whenever somebody says

116
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,291
I have to trust him.

117
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,750
That's not entirely
inappropriate, Alistair.

118
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,625
But there is another
consideration.

119
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,333
It'll be just your size
when it's finished.

120
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,291
Is that why you're
working for Osborn?

121
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:23,083
To serve up Spider-Man on a
platter, in exchange for this?

122
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:27,166
Alistair, that explosion back
at the old lab was my fault.

123
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,458
I'd do anything to help you.

124
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,416
Even working with Osborn?

125
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,375
Even that, Osborn's
not that bad.

126
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,333
Black Widow's ready.

127
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,583
[Kingpin] Does anyone
suspect that I'm involved?

128
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,208
No, not at all.

129
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,250
[Kingpin]Good, that is as it
should be.

130
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,583
Crime, my livelihood, my life,

131
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,000
all of it jeopardized

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,583
by the sudden appearance
of Spider-Man.

133
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,291
How can I run a
world-wide criminal empire

134
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,958
if I can't even control
my home base, New York?

135
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,583
The Black Widow can neutralize
all of Spider-man's powers.

136
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,833
That loose cannon
must be removed.

137
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,958
You don't have a
thing to worry about.

138
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,083
But you do, Osborn.

139
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:15,875
If it fails, I get
your company, remember?

140
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,250
Interesting way to pay
back a loan, isn't it?

141
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,125
The debt will be paid
in full as of tomorrow.

142
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,958
Something that occurs to me.

143
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:28,333
Either Spider-Man is
destroyed, or you get Oscorp.

144
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,875
Whatever happens, you win.

145
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:34,708
That's why I'm the
Kingpin [chuckles].

146
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,166
-Ready?
-I'm not sure.

147
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,166
The seekers found
Spider-Man once, Alistair.

148
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,125
They can do it again.

149
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,708
If we find him, we've
got to destroy him.

150
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,583
Because with Spider-Man, you
don't get a second chance.

151
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,458
[man] Doesn't your dad usually
come to these things, Osborn?

152
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,125
I borrowed his ticket.

153
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,000
There's some big deal
at his factory tonight.

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,458
He wouldn't tell me
what, never does.

155
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,166
Do we have to talk about work?

156
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,250
It's so boring.

157
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,875
Flash, everything's working
out so well tonight.

158
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,583
Jameson was--

159
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:17,875
Felicia?

160
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,583
Peter Parker!

161
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,500
Wonder who his hot date is.

162
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,375
Isn't it incredible?

163
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,833
Just like I told you.

164
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,583
It's nice, Peter.

165
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,583
But I'd be just as happy
watching my cable TV.

166
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,166
Aunt May, you need to
get out once in a while.

167
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,583
That's his date?

168
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,583
I think it's sweet.

169
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,708
I wonder who she is.

170
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,500
You should have brought Mary
Jane, Anna Watson's niece.

171
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,833
A blind date?

172
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,125
-Come on, Aunt May, I--
-Parker!

173
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,333
You look incredible.

174
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,875
Um... Aunt May,
this is Felicia Hardy.

175
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,625
Very nice to meet you.

176
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,000
Mind if I borrow your
nephew for a dance?

177
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,375
Well, I--

178
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,458
Felicia, I should
be taking pictures.

179
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,250
And I should be dancing
with Flash Thompson.

180
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,458
Could've had some boring
blind date instead of this?

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,583
Yeah, right.

182
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,333
I had a feeling this
might happen, come on.

183
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,083
[man] Parker's not gonna dance
Felicia away from me.

184
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,875
[chuckles] You look just
like your big hero.

185
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,166
I'd better, I paid enough to
rent this thing
for the frat party.

186
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,375
Well, what do you
think Peter will do

187
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,583
when he sees you in it?

188
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,583
Don't know what he'll do.

189
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,833
Just don't be standing too
close to him when he does it.

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,875
[Spencer] Got him,
he's at 39th and 2nd.

191
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,958
Hey, that's
Jonah Jameson's place.

192
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,583
Ho ho, the boss's gonna
have a front row seat.

193
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,958
Good for him.

194
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,458
Now let's get this over with.

195
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:52,458
[loud engine swoosh]

[claps]

197
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,458
You're a good dancer,
I'm surprised.

198
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,500
Well, a lot of things about
me would surprise you.

199
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,125
I love surprises.

200
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,708
See what you think of this one.

201
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,458
[Peter] Something's
wrong, why now?

202
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,708
Peter?

203
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,125
Why, what does he want?

204
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,958
Felicia, it's just
some imposter.

205
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,458
But how would you know that?

206
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,333
Uh, yeah, yeah, maybe
it really is him.

207
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:28,208
Spider-Man is here, in my home?

208
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,208
Parker, it's time
we had a talk.

209
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,250
About what, Spider-Man?

210
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,000
About those pictures
you're always taking of me.

211
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,250
I don't like'em.

212
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,333
Well, I'm sorry.

213
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,958
That's a little better,
but it's still not good enough.

214
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,333
Well, what would
you like me to say?

215

-[screaming]
-Okay, aah!

216

Peter!

220
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,458
Stay in here, Aunt May.

-But Peter, I--
-I'll be okay, I hope.

You, you're ruining
everything [screams].

223

Leave her alone!

You wanna dance with
somebody? Dance with me.

The fight of the century
and no photographer!

226
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,500
Parker, where are you?

227
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,250
Hey, Toro, Toro!

228
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,416
When you crash a party,
you really crash it!

229
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,583
Oh, oh.

Where did he go?

00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:57,583
There, Spencer,
go back, get him!

233
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,875
Get him!

A million bucks, that's
what this is gonna cost me.

[TV Announcer] Spider-Man
appears to be dazed!

238

Huh, what was that?

239
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,291
[Eddie] With
Spider-Man unconscious,

240
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,958
we have a rare opportunity.

241
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,500
And here it is, the moment all
America has been waiting for,

242
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,166
the unmasking of Spider-Man.

243
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,750
So that's what this was
about, Brock's big scoop!

244
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,375
Looks like it was
worth all the damage.

245
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,166
And now, live, and
exclusively--

246
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,958
Cut to the chase, Brock!

[Aunt May] Flash Thompson!

You know him?

250
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,000
He goes to school with
my nephew, Peter Parker.

251
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,416
Wait a minute,
are you telling me

252
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,875
Spider-Man's just
some goofy kid?

253
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,125
That's unbelievable.

254
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,625
How can anything
be unbelievable

255
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,583
to a guy who
publishes a tabloid?

256

[gasps] Spider-Man!

257
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,458
And there you have it, America.

258
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,625
Minutes from now,
the police, huh?

259
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,708
Ladies and gentlemen
this is amazing,

260
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,625
some men just broke into
the lab here at Oscorp.

261
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:31,125
Ah... Sir, excuse me, but,
what do you want?

262
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,291
Him.

263

I thought we were going to hand

264
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,291
Spider-Man over to the police.

265
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,875
What's going on, Osborn?

266
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,458
I had nothing to do
with this, nothing.

267
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,625
I trusted you.

268

Hey, hey, I got first
amendment rights.

How about that, I'm
in two places at once!

can practically smell him,

boy is in big trouble.

try to save him?

gotta save the guy

Don't know, better
finish him off
and get out of here.

Otherwise the Kingpin
will finish us off.

So that's her name, huh?
Black Widow!

00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,166
I already know you're stronger
than me,

306
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,958
but maybe this'll
give me an edge.

Hey guys, chill,
the Widow and I

are trying to share
some quality time.

your cooperation.

No Spider splat,
no hover chair.

All right, but take
Alistair out of here.

No, you can't stay!
