00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,875
I would not be averse
to some assistance!

[Spider-Man groans]

00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,750
Why does my business with you

166
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,500
keep getting
interrupted, Landon?

167
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Ever heard of karma?

Spider-Man! Keep us still
or Wolverine is lost to us!

172
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,708
[grunts] No problem,
but whatever you do,

173
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,166
just don't make me laugh!

174
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,208
Logan! Snap out of it, Logan!

[camera motor whirs]

Situation critical, sir!

178
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,416
Landon's chasing Hobgoblin,

179
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,708
Spider-Man and the Mutants
are wrecking the lab!

180
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,083
And what about the mutant army

181
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,000
that Landon was
to create for me?

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,708
I don't think that was even
Landon's intention, sir.

183
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:36,000
How disappointing.
Evacuate immediately.

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,458
I no longer have need for
a spy on those premises.

185
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,708
My men and I are bailing
out, operation terminated.

186
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,708
I told you not to trust Landon!

187
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,583
Mind yourself, Smythe,
or I may take out

188
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,875
my frustration on you,
do you understand?

189
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,166
Quite.

190
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,416
Landon! I've wiped
out all the data

191
00:10:56,416 --> 00:11:00,625
in your little computer,
and now I have this!

What's it worth to ya?

about losers being weepers?

too immersed in your work.

I've always wanted you.

is gone, therefor...

Not one I would care
to duplicate, Logan.

What is that stuff?

Dr. Landon's in there!
We've got to get him out!

[Landon screams]

What is happenin' to him?

234
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,333
[Beast] Landon was
so anxious to create

235
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,583
something toxic to
mutants, that he failed

236
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,583
to determine its effect
on normal human cells!

237

Do something! You're
mutants, use your powers!

There is nothing we can do.

How ironic, he is becoming
what he hated most: mutant.

form that control panel!

Mr. Landon!
He can help you,

243
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,000
it was his work that created
all this, remember?

What?

Forgive me, Logan. I will
explain when this is over.

00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,291
Remind me not to ask.

[Landon roars]

That's no way to
treat a lady, pal.

You sure showed him.

Shut up, ya puny little geek.

[roars]

254
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,166
It's my worst fear,

255
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,500
turning into some mutated
thing like that.

256
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,291
And now,
I've got to stop it!

He's heading for midtown, Hank!

259
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,583
Apparently only the infusion

260
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,875
of electrical energy
can ease its pain.

261
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,458
If we don't do something,

262
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,458
it's gonna drain the
entire city's power!

263
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,250
And if it does,
it will become immense.

[Reporter] This
is John V in with

267
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,416
a J3 News Network live report.

268
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,000
A monstrous creature

269
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,875
apparently drawing energy
from the city's

270
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,083
electric power grid
has escaped

271
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,416
from the Brand Corporation,

272
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,416
where Herbert Landon
has been carrying on
mutant genetic research.

273
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:37,000
The creature is
now terrorizing the city,

274
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,875
and heading
for Times Square!

275
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,875
And the police are
unable to stop it!

276
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,875
[Professor X] Are you getting
this news feed, Rogue?

277
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,083
[Rogue] I'm gettin'
it loud and clear!

00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,125
That is one ugly critter!

279
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,500

are down there,

00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,500
We're on our way, Professor.

[Rogue] Why don't you pick on

284
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,375
somebody your own size,
big fella?

285
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,416
[Rogue grunts]

286
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,458
Gotcha!

287
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,125
I'll bet you say
that to all the gals.

288
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,458
We came as soon as we heard
the news, what can we do?

289
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,708
Landon was using
physio-electrical energy

290
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,583
to stimulate the mutant
cells to self destruct.

291
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,458
Now he needs it to hold
his own cells together!

292
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,958
Yes, that would explain
Landon's craving
for electricity!

293
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,291
He is a walking
storage battery.

294
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,208
But what if we
shut off his power?

295
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,458
It would slow his
growth, but not stop it.

296
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,083
However, if we
short-circuited the

297
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,750
physio-electrical
energy field...

298
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,166
Right,
I'll just climb up there,

299
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,166
hand him a wire and
say "Hold this!"

300
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,750
[Spider-Man] Wait! We
can do it remotely!

301
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,208
If we had a microwave
antenna adjusted

302
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,208
to the right frequency,
and a transmitter

303
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,333
big enough to hold
all that energy...

304
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,708
Yes, that would
work! We have both

305
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,833
in the Blackbird!
Come with me!

306
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,708
So there appears to
be a keen scientific mind

307
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,583
behind that garish
mask, eh my friend?

308
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,291
Takes one to know one,
blue boy.

309
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,500
[Spider-Man] Set the
frequency at 28 microfarads.

310
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,458
Done, begin sequence to
align the two antennae.

311
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,166
[Landon roars]

312
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,583
Antennae aligned.

313
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,333
Now it's their
turn on the ground.

314
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,708

I got her!

Perfect! Now we must make sure
that Landon isn't grounded.

324
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,458
Rogue! Your turn!

325
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,333
Be careful!

Don't worry about me, sugar.

[Wolverine] What's wrong?

334
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,083
The creature's too heavy!

We're going down!

Brace yourself for a crash!

No. No more suffering!

Something has taken
control of the ship!

We're leveling off.

You mean they won't be

I like it!

Thank you for saving us, and
for accepting what you are.

You know?

Know what?

346

She is a mutant, a telekinetic.

347
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,583
I've suspected as
much for a long time.

348
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:06,125
A mutant? Of course,
it all makes sense now!

349
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,958
You were the one
who rescued me

350
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,416
in the auditorium when
the ceiling caved in.

351

It's true, I am a mutant.

352
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,458
That's why I first went
to work for Landon.

353
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,291
I had hoped he really
did have a cure.

354
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,708
I can relate to that.

but what about the
monster within me?

00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,125
You are possessed
by no monster,

00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,458
only your own fear
and confusion.

We will introduce you
to Professor Xavier,

Maybe somewhere there's
someone who can help me too.

the load by yourself.
