but I hate Spider-Man

168
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,125
for doing this to Michael.

169
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:27,291
I hate him
with all my heart and soul.
[crying]

170
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
People of New York,

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,166
haven't we had enough
of this wall crawling menace?

172
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,166
Surely there's some way
to rid ourselves of Spider-Man.

173
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,458
Some way we can
protect the lives

174
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,458
of innocent people
like Michael Morbius.

175
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,000
If ever there was a cue, Frank,
this is it.

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,416
If you bring
Spider-Man in alive,

177
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,083
it'd be a big step toward

178
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,166
redeeming yourself
in the eyes of the law.

179
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,875
That doesn't matter to me.

180
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,458
All I care about is
stopping the slime bags

181
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,291
who prey on innocent lives.

182
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,958
Fine. But as your partner
and your friend,

183
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,458
I care about you.

184
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,500
I don't want you to end up
in jail or worse.

185
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,166
Just do this one job
to patch up your reputation.

186
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,083
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

187
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,583
And use the non-lethal
ordinance this time, OK?

188
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,708
All right.

189

Do it your way.

190
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,958
Just this once.

And so, people of New York,

this is a breaking story.

be Spider-Man,
